<h5>A MILL-HAND'S MANSION.</h5>

<p>'It's a dreadful thing to have a father you don't
respect,' said Sarah Clay, as she walked into
the gilded and beautifully painted drawing-room
of the aforesaid father's mansion in Yorkshire.</p>

<p>Her mother gave a little, sharp scream, and let
fall the book she was holding in her hand.</p>

<p>Sarah came forward swiftly, picked it up, and
turned it over to look at the title, at sight of
which she said, with a little laugh, 'What a humbug
you are, mother! You know you've never read a
single word of this book.'</p>

<p>Mrs Clay's face flushed crimson. ''Ow dare you
talk similar to that, Sarah?' Only she pronounced it
fairly with a true cockney accent, and left out all her
<i>h</i>'s. 'I don't know w'at women are comin' to nowadays,
w'at wi' one thing an' another, w'en it comes to
a chit o' sixteen talkin' like that about 'er mother
bein' an 'umbug, let alone sayin' she doesn't respect
'er father; an' w'at 'e'd say if 'e 'eard 'er I couldn't
say, I'm sure,' she said, flustered.</p>

<p>'Then don't say it,' observed Sarah lightly, as she
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
threw herself lazily into one of the luxurious armchairs
opposite her mother, and only then became aware
that buried in the depths of another easy-chair was
another figure&mdash;that of a man. For a moment she
was taken aback, and started in fright, thinking that
it was her father, of whom she might speak disrespectfully
behind his back, but whom she did not
dare to abuse to his face, fearless though she was by
nature. However, to her relief, she saw it was not
her father's big, burly form that filled the gold-brocaded
chair, but her brother's tall, slight figure.</p>

<p>'Awfully bad form, Sarah,' he murmured in an
effeminate voice, after which he laid his head back
in an attitude of exhaustion against the chair, and
gazed up at the ceiling.</p>

<p>'Yes; I think it must be that 'igh-class, fashionable
school that's taught 'er to speak so of 'er parents, an'
not respect any one,' agreed her mother in querulous
accents.</p>

<p>'I didn't mean to speak disrespectfully to you, dear
old mother,' said the girl with a kind of patronising
affection.</p>

<p>'I don't know w'at you call it, then, callin' me an
'umbug,' objected Mrs Clay.</p>

<p>'I was in fun, and you know it <i>is</i> humbug your
pretending to read Gibbon's <i>Decline and Fall of the
Roman Empire</i>,' persisted Sarah.</p>

<p>At the title, the youth in the armchair roused himself,
and said in quite a different tone, 'Were you
reading that, mater? Is it my copy?'</p>

<p>'Well, I can't say I'd really read it, not to understand
it; but I saw it was one o' the books you were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
studyin', an' I thought I'd take a look at it just to
know a little w'at you were studyin' w'en you got
back to college,' said his mother apologetically.</p>

<p>'That's awfully nice of you, mater; but why didn't
you ask me about it? I'd have told you anything
you wanted to know about my work. That's such
a frightfully dry book. I should grind it up for my
trip,' replied her son.</p>

<p>'I don't know that I want to know about "trips;"
but I feel I ought to try an' educate myself now you
two are comin' on, so as not to disgrace you,' began
his mother.</p>

<p>But her son, with an impatient movement&mdash;which,
however, he immediately suppressed&mdash;interrupted her.
'Dear mater, what does it matter whether you are
learned or not? For my part, I don't see what
women want to be educated for at all.'</p>

<p>'Oh, you don't, don't you? You ought to have
lived about the year one. You're several centuries
behind the times, George!' exclaimed his sister indignantly.</p>

<p>'I wish I had. I'm sure the girls of that time
were nicer than they are nowadays,' he replied,
calmly relapsing into his nonchalant attitude.</p>

<p>'I'm sure they never talked about not respectin'
their dads,' said Mrs Clay plaintively. She had, as
will be seen, a habit of harping back to the same
grievance, and this remark of her daughter's evidently
rankled in her mind.</p>

<p>'Perhaps their fathers were more respectable than
mine,' replied Sarah.</p>

<p>'Well, I never did!' cried Mrs Clay, scandalised.</p>

<p>'Draw it mild, Sarah! The pater may be a bit of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
a tartar sometimes, but he's respectable enough, in all
conscience,' remonstrated her brother.</p>

<p>'I don't think so,' declared Sarah.</p>

<p>Before her mother could utter the protests which
her son saw in her face, George said, 'Oh, let her talk!
She's got some maggot in her brain, and she wants
to air it. It amuses her, and it doesn't hurt us, as
long as the pater doesn't come in and hear her; and
she'll take good care to shut up if he does,' he
wound up with a laugh.</p>

<p>His laugh exasperated his sister, and she retorted
with some warmth, 'If I do shut up when he comes
in, it's only because he's so violent and hateful!'</p>

<p>'Sarah! Sarah!' came from the mother and son
simultaneously, in accents of horrified indignation;
and Mrs Clay continued, 'Leave the room at once,
miss. I won't sit 'ere an' 'ave my 'usband insulted
like that.'</p>

<p>Without a word, the girl rose from her seat and
left the drawing-room, shutting the door sharply
behind her.</p>

<p>'What's the governor been doing to upset her
now?' inquired Mr George Clay of his mother.</p>

<p>'Nothin' that I know of. It's some crotchet of
Sairey, now she's begun studyin' the woman's
question, as she calls it, an' thinks 'e treats the
women 'ere badly.'</p>

<p>'Oh goodness, don't you tell me she's started that!
Do they go in for politics at that school, then?' cried
her brother. 'I never heard of such a thing at a
girls' school; it ought not to be allowed.'</p>

<p>'Well, I don't know that it's politics exactly; it's
somethin' to do wi' women's duties to each other an'
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
the 'ard life our mill-lasses 'ave, or somethin'. She
was talkin' to me the other evenin' about it, quite
beautifully; an' I will say that for Sairey, she don't
mind my not understandin', but explains, an' never
seems to despise me for my ignorance,' said his
mother.</p>

<p>'I should think not, indeed! Book-learning isn't
everything. With all your experience of life you
could teach Sarah a precious sight more than she can
teach you,' said George.</p>

<p>'It's very nice o' you to talk like that, dear; but
I know you're both far above me wi' your beautiful
manners an' ways o' talkin',' said the poor woman
humbly.</p>

<p>'For goodness' sake, don't talk like that, mother, or
I shall be sorry I ever went to Eton and Cambridge
if it makes you feel any distance between us!' he
cried.</p>

<p>'I don't feel it so much wi' you, dear. It's Sairey
I feel it worse wi', an' it's not 'er fault either; it's
only that she's so clever an' so beautiful.'</p>

<p>'She's good-looking, certainly; but, then, so are you.
She's taken after you, like me.' The young man
smiled at his mother in a very pretty way. He
certainly had beautiful manners, as his mother said.
'But as for being clever,' he continued, 'I call her a
proud peacock.'</p>

<p>'Oh George, I was never as good-lookin' as Sairey,
nor you either; nor 'alf such a lady. W'y, she might
be a duchess's daughter! Every one says so,' cried
his mother, woman-like, dwelling upon the subject of
good looks rather than on her son's criticism of
Sarah's cleverness.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
'That's only education. You'd have been just as
duchessy if you'd been educated,' insisted her son,
hesitating for a word to use instead of lady-like,
for he would not, even to himself, own that his
mother was not a lady in the world's acceptation of
the word.</p>

<p>What every one in the West Riding, or heavy
woollen district, said was, what a most extraordinary
thing it was that the son and daughter
of that brute Clay should be so refined when their
father was such a rough, uncouth man! The Clay
family was one of the many instances in Yorkshire
of the mill-hand who rose from being a labourer to
be the owner of a large mill and enormous wealth,
and who gave to his children the education he had
never received himself. But though in most cases
the children were better educated and superior in
outward seeming to their parents, it was not often
that the contrast was so marked. In this case it
may have been caused by the fact that Mark Clay,
instead of marrying a mill-lass, had taken to wife a
very pretty, delicate-looking girl from London, who
had bequeathed her good looks to her two children.
She, or rather her husband&mdash;for little Mrs Clay had
no voice in the matter&mdash;had sent the boy to Eton
and then to Cambridge, and the girl to what her
mother called a ''igh-class, fashionable school'&mdash;which,
if high prices are any criterion, it certainly was.</p>

<p>Mrs Clay shook her head at her son's last remark.
'I should never 'ave made a duchess. I was always
timid, an' couldn't 'old up my 'ead as Sairey does.
It's somethin' in you both, though I don't 'old wi'
Sairey speakin' of 'er father in the way she does.'</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
'I should think not, indeed,' put in her son.</p>

<p>'Still, we can't expect 'er to respect us as much as
she would if we 'ad the same good manners an' way
o' talkin' that she an' you 'ave. It's natural she
should feel superior, an' show it, too,' argued the poor
woman with some shrewdness; 'an' I've told your
dad that it was only w'at 'e might 'ave expected.'</p>

<p>'Pray, don't talk of Sarah's manners being good,
nor her way of talking either; they're both as bad
as bad can be,' said George Clay, with his soft drawl.</p>

<p>'W'y, you don't never mean to say that, George,
an' after all the pounds dad's paid for 'er? For
goodness' sake, don't tell 'im, or 'e'll 'alf-kill 'er&mdash;'e
would! You don't know your father as I do,' cried
the mother in consternation.</p>

<p>An expression of annoyance came over her son's
face at these words. 'Don't make the pater out
worse than he is, my dear mother. He may be
violent at times, but I hope he knows better than
to use physical force. Anyway, I shall not tell him
anything of the sort, and when I say her manners
are bad and her language unlady-like'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'But that's just w'at 'e thinks it isn't; an' though
'e gets angry, 'e thinks a lot o' 'er. An' w'en I don't
like the words she uses sometimes, 'e says I don't
know the way o' society; that the aristocracy speak
like that, an' be'ave so, too.'</p>

<p>'Well, so they do, some of them,' admitted her son.</p>

<p>But before he could finish his remark his mother
interrupted him. 'Well, then, that's w'at 'e wants;
so if you tell 'im that, dear, 'e'll be in a good temper
for the rest o' the evenin'.' She looked wistfully at
her son as she made this suggestion.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
He laughed good-humouredly. 'All right, mother;
if Sarah gives him some of her cheek to-night I'll
tell him it's the fashion of the day. It's true
enough; but, oh dear! I wish you wouldn't have
such fearfully long dinners. That's not the fashion;
it's the thing to starve.'</p>

<p>'It's not a bit o' good you tellin' 'im <i>that</i>, for 'e
says 'e can afford a Lord Mayor's banquet every day
'e likes, an' 'e 'll 'ave it, an' 'e can't abear to see you
sittin' there pickin' at a bit o' chicken, an' not even
takin' whisky-an'-soda wi' him.'</p>

<p>'Well, I must go and dress for this Lord Mayor's
banquet, and so must you, mother; so go and put on
your black silk,' he remarked, as he rose lazily from
his armchair.</p>

<p>'Not that old dress, dear; it's so plain an' dowdy.
I've somethin' better than that;' and, looking as
pleased as a young girl at his interest in her dress,
she went off nodding and smiling at the thought of
the pleasure she was going to give him at sight of her
new finery.</p>

<p>George Clay was just going to beg her not to put
on anything better than the black silk, but on second
thoughts checked himself. After all, if it pleased her
that was the chief thing, not to mention that his
father would probably think her choice more suited
to his banquet, for such the dinners at the Clays'
might well be called.</p>

<p>On her way to her own room Mrs Clay had to pass
her daughter's suite of rooms, and after a little hesitation
she knocked at the door of her boudoir.</p>

<p>'Come in,' said a voice, and she entered.</p>

<p>Sarah was sitting on the wide window-seat, looking
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
out over the park towards the town, the tall factory
chimneys of which could be seen, at the bottom of the
hill, belching out their volumes of smoke, which made
even the trees in the park unfit to touch, thanks to
the soot it deposited upon their leaves, stems, and
trunks.</p>

<p>'W'y, Sairey, ain't you goin' to begin to dress?
W'y 'asn't Naomi put out your things?' exclaimed
her mother.</p>

<p>'I'm not coming down to-night; I don't want to
see your husband,' said Sarah, still staring out into
the park.</p>

<p>'My 'usband, indeed! Who do you think you're
talkin' to? You seem to forget I'm your own
mother, an' that my 'usband, as you call 'im, is
your father, miss! 'Usband, indeed!' cried Mrs Clay.</p>

<p>'You're sure there's no mistake, mother? You're
sure he <i>is</i> my father? I sometimes wonder if I could
have been kidnapped as a baby, and changed.'</p>

<p>But she got no further, for little Mrs Clay could
stand no more. 'You're my child, Sairey. Though
you're a deal better-lookin' than ever I was, you are
like enough for any one to know I'm your mother,'
she protested.</p>

<p>'I wish to goodness I wasn't! Oh mother, don't
look like that! I didn't mean you, of course. I'm
glad to be your child; but, oh, why did you marry
that man? Now, if you had only married Uncle
Howroyd.'</p>

<p>'Seein' that I 'ave married 'im, an' that 'e's your
father, it's no use talkin' about such things. An',
dear, 'e's not as bad as 'e might be. 'E doesn't drink
nor beat me,' she said.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
'Mother, you talk as if he were a coalheaver,' cried
her daughter indignantly.</p>

<p>''E wasn't a coalheaver; but 'e was a mill-'and, an'
I was a milliner's girl in a little shop in London w'en
I married 'im, an' I 'adn't a farthing. An' look at the
beautiful 'ouse I'm mistress o' now, an' look at the
money 'e spends on you an' me both&mdash;never stints us
for anythin'! I'm sure you ought to be grateful to
'im. I am, for I never expected to rise to this w'en I
was a milliner's 'prentice in London.'</p>

<p>'You needn't talk about that. It's bad enough to
be a vulgar millionaire's daughter,' replied the girl,
and at the same time she dropped from the window-seat
and came towards her mother; adding, 'Well, if
you want me to come down to dinner I suppose I
must ring for Naomi. It's an awful nuisance, and
I shall probably have a row with the pater.'</p>

<p>Mrs Clay was going to plead with her daughter as
she had with her son; but Sarah, who had suggested
dressing partly to get rid of her mother, pointed to
the clock, and Mrs Clay hurried away to get ready
for dinner herself.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></h3>

<h5>A DREARY BANQUET.</h5>

<p>After the mother had left the room, her
daughter seemed in no hurry to get ready
for dinner; she turned back to the window,
and, taking up her old position on the wide window-seat,
sat gazing down at the hideous view of the big
manufacturing town, with blackened buildings and
tall, smoky chimneys, which lay at the bottom of
the hill, and seemed to have a weird fascination for
her. It must certainly have been from choice that
Sarah Clay looked at them, for she had only to sit at
the other side of the broad window-seat, turn her
back on Ousebank, and, looking out on the other side of
the hill, she would have had a beautiful view over the hill
of pretty vales and villages and smiling pasture, and
their own fine park; but the girl deliberately turned
her back upon nature, and looked not upon art&mdash;for
art there was not in Ousebank except what was produced
in the mills&mdash;but upon nature perverted by
man, who had turned the beautiful vale into a Black
Country with its big factories, which polluted earth
and sky, air and water.</p>

<p>She was still staring out with a frown on her face
when a knock came to the door, and she called out,
'Come in,' without turning her head to see who the
new-comer was.</p>

<p>'Excuse me, miss,' said the voice of the maid, 'but
the mistress sent me with this, and you'll best be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
getting ready for dinner, for it's late.'</p>

<p>Sarah turned her head, with the air that her mother
declared was like that of a duchess's daughter, and
looked at the large cardboard box which her maid
held in her arms, with a gaze which, to do her justice,
she was quite unconscious was haughty. 'What is
it?' she asked shortly.</p>

<p>'You just come and see, Miss Sarah,' replied the
maid quite politely, but with Yorkshire independence.</p>

<p>Sarah did not resent the tone of the advice, but
came slowly from her window-seat, and watched the
maid undo the string of the box and take out, with
many exclamations of admiration, a beautiful white
silk frock elaborately trimmed with lace and ribbons.</p>

<p>'It's grand! Oh miss, make haste and let me do
your hair, and put it on you!' cried the maid.</p>

<p>'Now? I have no time. Put it away, and get out
my white muslin, Naomi,' replied Sarah, and she
turned away after hardly a glance at the pretty
dress.</p>

<p>'But you are to wear it to-night. At least, the
mistress said would you, please, put it on,' corrected
Naomi, as she saw her young mistress's look of indignation
at the peremptory order.</p>

<p>Sarah was just going to refuse decidedly; but the
thought of her mother's disappointment made her
hesitate. The girl had good enough taste to feel that
the dress was far too smart for an ordinary family
dinner; but, then, as she reflected, it would be in keeping
with the rest, which was far too smart, all of it.
So she said, 'Very well. Make haste, Naomi.'</p>

<p>'There, miss, you look just like a queen, and fit to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
live in a palace; though, to be sure, ours is one, or as
good as one. Now, just look in the glass and see if
you aren't lovely.'</p>

<p>'Yes; it's very pretty,' said Sarah impatiently.</p>

<p>'Are you ill, miss? You don't seem a bit pleased
to have such beautiful things. I'm sure if I had
everything I could wish for like you I'd be as happy as
a queen,' observed Naomi, whom Sarah allowed to
say what she liked; in the first place, because she was
the daughter of the head mill-watchman, and her
family had all&mdash;some still did&mdash;worked in Clay's
Mills; and, in the second place, because they had
played together as little children.</p>

<p>'I dare say you would; so am I, because a queen is
not at all a happy person; at least, if she is, it's not
because she is a queen and can have lots of new
dresses and things,' remarked Sarah.</p>

<p>'You wouldn't talk like that if you'd ever had to
do without them,' replied the girl.</p>

<p>Sarah turned round and faced the girl. 'Naomi,'
she said passionately, 'I'd give anything on earth to
be poor and work for my living as you do.'</p>

<p>'Oh miss!' cried Naomi, and 'Oh Sal!' cried
another voice, whose owner had overheard this last
remark.</p>

<p>For Mrs Clay had just entered the room, and had
forgotten that her daughter objected strongly to this
shortening of her name, which it was one of her
father's aggravating habits to do. 'Oh Sarah,' she
cried, 'don't talk such nonsense, and before Naomi,
too! Some must be poor an' some rich. It's always
been so, and always will be so, an' it's flyin' in the
face o' Providence not to be thankful that you're not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
poor; an' with that lovely gown on, too. 'Ow could
you earn enough money to buy a gown like that, do
you suppose? W'y, Naomi doesn't earn enough in a
year to pay for it, I'd have you to know.'</p>

<p>'Then she ought to,' began Sarah; whereupon Mrs
Clay cleared her throat noisily, and said in quite a
decided tone for her, 'That'll do, Naomi; you can
leave the room.' And when Naomi had done so, she
continued in a tone of reproof to her daughter,'What
are you thinkin' of, wishin' you earned your own
livin' like Naomi? A nice one you'd be if such a
dreadful thing 'appened to you, wi' your 'aughty
airs an' scornful ways that no one would put up
wi', let alone that you could never earn a penny if
you tried.'</p>

<p>'I'm not so sure about that. I've a good mind to
try, to show you that you're wrong,' said Sarah
meditatively.</p>

<p>Her mother cast a frightened glance at her, and
said soothingly, 'There, my dearie, there's no need
to think about it; you're far too pretty even to do
such a thing. You were born for a mansion, an' I
'ope you'll always 'ave one to live in.'</p>

<p>'I don't. I hope I shall one day have to work for
my living, and I shall do it whether it is necessary or
not, you'll see,' she declared.</p>

<p>Fortunately both the dinner-gong and an elaborate
set of chimes rang out through the house, and Mrs
Clay, with a nervous start, said hurriedly, 'There's
the chimes! Well, we must be goin'. Don't you look
grand to-night, Sairey?'</p>

<p>'That's just what I feel, mother&mdash;a great deal too
grand for a quiet family dinner; and so are you,' she
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
added, as she looked critically at her mother in the
elaborately trimmed, plum-coloured silk dress, so rich
that it seemed to prop up the delicate little woman
and almost stifle her with its heavy gold trimmings
and fringes.</p>

<p>'It's to please your father and George, and nothing's
too grand to do that,' said Mrs Clay, as she went out
of the room, making a rustle as she passed along
the richly carpeted passages and down the grand
marble staircase into the drawing-room. Mr Clay
did not trouble himself to go into the drawing-room
to fetch his wife, but always walked straight to the
dining-room at the first note of the chimes.</p>

<p>George was waiting, as he did every evening, to
give his arm to escort his mother to the dining-room,
and took her to the dinner-table, where his wife and
children found Mark Clay sitting at the top of the
large table which groaned under its massive gold
ornaments and plate. He was a big, bull-faced man;
at first sight so different from his son and daughter
that the latter might almost be forgiven her extraordinary
suggestion to her mother that perhaps he
was not her father at all! It would require a closer
observer than Sarah to see a certain set of the chin
which was common to him and his two children,
though hers took the form of haughtiness, and her
brother's had such a pleasant, if indolent, expression
that his father had never discovered this hidden
characteristic.</p>

<p>'Well, lass, thee'rt grand to-night. How much
did tha gown cost? A pretty penny, I'll be bound.
Well, lasses will be lasses, and the mills can give as
many on 'em as ye like. An' your mother, too, though
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
she's a bit old for such vanity; it's the young uns as
want fine feathers. Now then, what are ye scowling
at?' cried her father, all in the broadest Yorkshire.</p>

<p>'It's the fashion to scowl at personal remarks,
my dear father,' remarked George, as he 'played,' in
his mother's words, with his food.</p>

<p>'Then it's one fashion thee'll ha' to onlearn, dost
hear? I'll ha' no lass o' mine scowling at me at my
own table,' replied her father, as he brought his fist
down on the table with a thump, which made his poor
wife jump as well as the crystal and glass, 'which it's
a wonder he don't have of gold too,' his well-bred
butler observed, with a touch of contempt for his
master, which he allowed himself to vent to the
equally well-bred housekeeper, and to her only.</p>

<p>George stepped into the breach again. 'How's
the market, dad?' he inquired. 'Wool's going up, I
hear.'</p>

<p>'Wool's going up, you hear? An' what might you
know about wool? Nought as I know of. I wish
you did; but there, thee'rt too fine for t' wool-trade,
and thou'll never need to know about it, only to
spend money,' said the millionaire, purposely, as his
son believed, talking in such broad Yorkshire as is
not often heard nowadays, and so broad as to be unintelligible
to the reader of this tale, for which reason
it must be taken for granted, as perhaps his wife's
cockney dialect had better be.</p>

<p>However, the inquiry had turned the mill-owner's
attention from his daughter and her unbending
attitude, and had apparently produced a good effect,
for Mr Clay, senior, seemed to be in a better temper
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
for the rest of the dinner, the long, wearisome dinner
which he was the only one who seemed to appreciate.</p>

<p>There was no conversation but the remarks made
in a gentle tone by George to his mother, to whom he
was as attentive as he would have been to the
highest and most beautiful lady in the land.</p>

<p>Sarah kept a silence which might have been considered
either sulky or dignified, and Mrs Clay responded
in low tones to her son's remarks.</p>

<p>Mr Clay did not condescend to talk to any of them.
His wife he never considered as a companion or a
person to be conversed with, women being inferior
beings in his eyes, and for this reason he did not talk
to Sarah, whom he treated with the same contempt, in
spite of being very proud of her looks and bearing;
while George he considered a nincompoop and weakling,
though he was secretly proud, too, of his fine
manners and aristocratic appearance.</p>

<p>And so the four ill-sorted people sat each at a
different side of the table, with a long stretch of
gold-decked and flower-laden cloth between them.
'And a good thing, too, or I think we should fight,'
announced Sarah one day.</p>

<p>Poor Mrs Clay put her hand to her head once or
twice, and her ever-observant son bent towards her
with solicitude as he inquired, 'Don't you feel well,
mother?'</p>

<p>'It's only the smell of all these flowers; they make
me feel faint-like,' she said.</p>

<p>'It's these lilies; they are too strong for a dining-table;
just take them away, Sykes,' he said to the
butler, who happened to be close behind George Clay's
chair.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
The man looked hesitatingly at his master, and
then at the young man, and apparently decided to
obey the younger one, whom he, like the rest of the
staff, liked and respected, instead of the father, whom
he detested, and who now cried in a voice of thunder,
'Leave 'em alone, I say! I don't pay for lilies to
be thrown away for a woman's whim. Leave 'em
alone.'</p>

<p>'They're cheap enough, and they really never are
used for table-decorating. It must have been a mistake
of the maid's. Sykes had better remove them, if
you don't mind,' said George.</p>

<p>Sykes, being of the same opinion, swiftly removed
the vase and handed it to one of the footmen.</p>

<p>Mr Clay, awed by his son's superior knowledge of
what was done and not done (in society, he supposed),
remained silent, and at last the banquet came to an
end, and with suspicious alacrity Mrs Clay and her
daughter rose and left the room, followed by George
after his usual murmured apology to his father for
not staying with him; for George Clay was as polite,
in an indolent way, to his father as he was to every
one else.</p>

<p>'Phew, I breathe again!' cried Sarah, as she
stamped her feet outside the dining-room door.</p>

<p>'Sh, sh, my dear! Your father might 'ear you.
The flowers did make the air sickly.'</p>

<p>'Flowers! It wasn't the flowers. It was everything.
I always think of Miss Kilmansegg and her
"Gold, gold; nothing but gold!" Phew! how I
loathe and detest it all!'</p>

<p>'Draw it mild, Sarah! Even gold has its advantages.'</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
'It mayn't have to every one's mind. Look what
an effeminate creature it's made of you!' she cried.</p>

<p>George Clay lit a cigarette, with a 'May I?' to his
mother, and only smiled as he leant back in an armchair
and puffed contentedly away.</p>

<p>Clearly Sarah was not able to rouse her brother by
her criticism.</p>

<hr class="para" />

<h5>STALLED OXEN.</h5>

<p>'Now then, now then; have I just come in time
for fireworks?' said a man's voice; and
Sarah felt a hearty clap of a man's firm
hand on her shoulder.</p>

<p>'Uncle Howroyd!' she cried, as she turned and
threw her arms round her uncle's neck.</p>

<p>'Gently there, my lass; you needn't stifle me if
you can't breathe yourself.&mdash;Well, George,' turning
to the youth, 'you find life very exhausting as usual,
I suppose. But, I say, you haven't got company,
I hope?' he inquired, as he noticed the elaborate
toilettes of the ladies.</p>

<p>'Oh no; we're only dressed for dinner. W'y
didn't you come in time for it, Bill? We've just
finished; but you'll find your brother in the dinin'-room,
an' he'll ring for something to be brought
back for you; there's plenty,' said Mrs Clay.</p>

<p>'I don't doubt that; but I've had my dinner,
thank you. I'm a plain man, as you know, Polly,
and my dinner isn't such a big affair as yours, by a
long way. And I'm not thirsty either, so I'll leave
Mark to drink his wine in peace and come along
with you into the drawing-room&mdash;or <i>salon</i>, is it you
call it?' he added, with good-humoured banter.</p>

<p>At that moment the voice of Mr Mark Clay could
be heard raised in angry tones, apparently scolding
the butler or some of his assistants, and Sarah
laughed as she said, 'You mean <i>you</i> want to be
left in peace. There's not much peace in that room
or anywhere else where that man is;' and she gave
a wave of her hand towards the dining-room.</p>

<p>Mr William Howroyd's bright, cheery face grew
grave as he said kindly but seriously, 'Nay, lass,
you shouldn't speak so of your father.'</p>

<p>'I don't see what difference that makes. I can't
help his being my father. People ought to be allowed
to choose. I would sooner have our watchman for
my father than him.'</p>

<p>'Nay, lass, you don't mean that, and I can't have
you speak like that of my brother,' said her uncle.</p>

<p>'He's only your step-brother, and you don't get on
with him any too well yourself. But don't look so
solemn. I'll be quite good and proper if you'll let
that twinkle come into your eye again; it isn't you
without a twinkle.'</p>

<p>Her uncle laughed good-humouredly as he took
his young niece's arm and followed his sister-in-law
into the drawing-room. His keen eye flashed round
the room, seeming to take in every detail in that
one look, just as in his own mill Mr William Howroyd
knew every 'hand' and everything they did or did
not do, as some of them declared. 'Why, what's
been doing here? Here's some fine painting!' he
exclaimed, as he went up to a panel in the wall
where a landscape was painted, evidently by a
master-hand.</p>

<p>'Yes, a Royal Academician came down from London
to do that; one thousand pounds it cost. Mark was
goin' to 'ave 'im do the lot; but 'e wouldn't do any
more after the first, so another man's got to come.'</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
'Ah, how's that?' inquired Mr Howroyd. 'It's
well done; you won't better this. Why, I see it's by
Brown&mdash;Sir John Brown. It's worth one thousand
pounds, is that.'</p>

<p>'Sir John? 'E wasn't no Sir; just plain Mr Brown
'e was, though 'e gave 'isself airs enough for a Sir,
an' wanted to dine with us&mdash;a common painter
chap!' said Mrs Clay.</p>

<p>George Clay looked annoyed, and coloured at his
uncle's amused laugh; his love and loyalty to his
mother were much tried when she made a speech of
this kind, which, to do her justice, was not often,
and generally was, as in this case, an echo of her
husband's opinions. 'My dear mother, I had no idea
that it was Brown you had here. Why, he's a
gentleman we might be proud to see at our table.
I wish I had been at home,' he said hastily.</p>

<p>'W'at did 'e call 'isself Mr Brown for, then? If
we'd known 'e was a Sir John it would 'ave made
all the difference,' objected Mrs Clay.</p>

<p>'It ought not to have made any difference. A
man's a man, and with a talent like that even father
might have known better than to treat him like a
servant,' cried Sarah hotly.</p>

<p>'Well, it doesn't matter; it's over and past now.
And he wasn't Sir John then; he's only just been
made so, and I dare say he's forgotten all about
Ousebank and his treatment here; and for my part
I'd sooner have a picture on canvas that you can
take away than a painted panel. It's a lot of money
to give for that; though, to be sure, he can afford
that, can Mark,' said Mr Howroyd.</p>

<p>'Uncle Howroyd, why do you waste time at the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
end of your sentences like that, when you are always
saying you have no time to waste, because it is so
precious?'</p>

<p>'What are you after now, lass?' said her uncle,
bending his keen and kindly eyes upon his young
niece. 'I expect it's your uncle's rough north-country
tongue that's the matter. Come, out with it. What
have I said wrong now?'</p>

<p>'Oh, I don't mind your north-country tongue, as
you call it, only I don't like the way you repeat
yourself. You say, "That's a fine picture, is that,"
or "She's a good girl, is Sarah;" and it would be
quite enough and shorter to say, "That is a fine
picture," or "Sarah is a good girl."'</p>

<p>'Sarah! There's manners, correctin' your uncle;
a chit o' sixteen that's not left school yet!' protested
Mrs Clay.</p>

<p>'Don't you be corrected, Uncle Howroyd. It's
very musical the way north-countrymen repeat
themselves at the end of the sentence,' said George
gently.</p>

<p>Mr Howroyd paid no attention to the last two
speakers, but, with an amused twinkle in his eye,
tried the two ways of expressing himself. 'You're
right, lass; it's a waste of words, is that.'</p>

<p>There was a hearty laugh at this, in which both
Mrs Clay and her brother-in-law joined, as the latter
said, with a shake of his head, 'I'm afraid I'm too
old to get out of the habit of repeating myself. Still,
as I talk very fast, perhaps I don't waste so much
time after all; so I think you'll have to put up
with your old uncle's ways, and try and reform
some one else nearer home.'</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
'If you mean my father'&mdash;&mdash;began Sarah.</p>

<p>But the tone in which she said 'my father' made
her uncle interrupt her sharply. 'No, I don't. I
mean nearer home than that; I mean your own
tongue, young woman. You let it run on too fast
and too freely. I'm sure I don't know what kind
of a school that is that you're at; but they don't
teach you respect for your elders; and I'm beginning
to wonder if you've paid the twopence extra for
manners. If you have, you haven't got your two-pen'orth,
that's certain.'</p>

<p>'Oh yes, I have; only you don't understand them
up in the north,' replied Sarah airily, not in the least
abashed or offended, apparently, by her uncle's candid
criticism.</p>

<p>'No, we don't that,' he replied emphatically. But,
all the same, he most evidently cared more for Sarah
than he did for her mother or for her languid brother,
to whom he always talked with a kind of good-natured
contempt.</p>

<p>'The fact is, Uncle Howroyd, you're worried, and
your way of showing it is by scolding me, which is
not fair, as <i>I</i> am not the person you are angry with,
but some one whom you have come to see to-night,
unless I'm very much mistaken,' observed Sarah,
nodding her head knowingly at her uncle.</p>

<p>'You little witch! how dare you go guessing at
your uncle's private affairs like that?' cried Mr
William Howroyd, laughing at his niece.</p>

<p>'Oh, dear Bill, I 'ope there's nothin' wrong between
you an' Mark? Per'aps you'd better not say anythin'
to 'im to-night; 'e's a little put out, just for
the minute,' said Mrs Clay.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
'For the minute? I'd like to see him at a minute
when he isn't put out! And if you're going to say
anything to annoy him I wish you would say it
to-night, for I'd like to myself, only'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'She daren't!' put in George from the depths of
an armchair.</p>

<p>Mr William Howroyd turned from his handsome
niece, whose hair he was gently smoothing, to her
equally handsome brother, who was lying back in
the softest chair he could find (and they were all
comfortable, 'all of the best,' as Mark Clay said of
them, as of everything else he possessed). 'No; and
as for you, I don't suppose you'd trouble to say anything
to your father if it was to save you all from
the workhouse,' he said scornfully.</p>

<p>George Clay was nearly hidden from view by the
cushions he had carefully adjusted behind his head;
consequently the sudden slight start and swift opening
wide of his lazy-looking eyes passed unnoticed even
by the eyes of his uncle, who, indeed, would never
have thought of looking for alertness or energy in
his nephew. 'I might,' he replied lazily. 'I don't
fancy the workhouse. Is there any chance of it?'</p>

<p>Somehow every one seemed to think this a joke,
and his uncle remarked, 'No, the workhouse would
not suit you; no easy-chairs there. It might do
you good, though.'</p>

<p>'I wish there was a chance of it! Now that <i>would</i>
be life!' cried Sarah eagerly.</p>

<p>'Don't talk so silly, child; you don't know w'at
the work'ouse is like. It's enough to call down a
judgment upon you, bein' so ungrateful to Providence
for all the good things it's given you,' cried her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
mother. 'Fancy the work'ouse after <i>this</i>!' Mrs
Clay put a world of expression into the last word,
as she looked round the sumptuous drawing-room in
which they were gathered.</p>

<p>'Yes, it would be a change; though stranger things
have happened,' said Mr Howroyd in his brisk way,
and again he missed the look George shot at him.</p>

<p>'I should like to know if there is any chance of it,'
George remarked. 'You haven't answered my question
yet, uncle.'</p>

<p>'What question? Oh, whether there's any chance
of your ever going to the workhouse?' laughed his
uncle. 'How can I tell? One hears of kings
becoming beggars, so why not Mr George Clay?'</p>

<p>'There's no chance of that,' remarked George.</p>

<p>'How do you know?' began his uncle.</p>

<p>'Don't you be too sure. Our mills might be burnt
down, or anything might happen,' cried Sarah.</p>

<p>'Oh, if you mean by a beggar being penniless,
that's always possible, of course. What I meant was
that I should never beg,' said her brother with quiet
decision.</p>

<p>'What would you do? Work?' inquired his uncle.</p>

<p>'I fancy so,' said George; and they all laughed
again, as though the idea of George working was a
good joke.</p>

<p>But Mrs Clay added, 'An' I'm sure George is
clever enough to earn money in any way 'e likes;
though, thank 'eaven! 'e'll never 'ave to.'</p>

<p>'I'm not so sure of that,' replied that youth.</p>

<p>'What do you mean by that?' demanded his
uncle.</p>

<p>'Just what you meant,' replied the nephew, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
this time Mr William Howroyd was struck by the
expression on his nephew's face.</p>

<p>'I'm sure I don't know w'at you're all talkin'
about&mdash;work'ouses, an' workin' for your livin', an'
Sarah wishin' she was poor, an' all! W'ere's the
good of 'avin' riches if you can't enjoy it?' said
Mrs Clay plaintively. 'Look at this lovely 'ouse,
with everythin' in it that mortal man can wish for.
W'y, Mrs Haigh was 'ere to-day, and she says
Bucking'am Palace isn't grander, and she's been
there.'</p>

<p>'I dare say it isn't,' agreed her brother-in-law.</p>

<p>'Who's talking about Buckingham Palace?' cried
Mark Clay, as he came into the room.</p>

<p>'We were, Mark, and saying that it wasn't any
better than your place,' said his half-brother, as he
shook hands with the master of the house.</p>

<p>'Ay, you're right there; as far as money can go
you can't beat this house. But why didn't you coom
to dinner, lad?' he cried, his brother's remark having,
as the latter intended, put him in a good humour.</p>

<p>'Lad' in the north-country is as often used as
'man,' especially among relatives, and Mark Clay
used the word in a friendly way, though his brother
was near fifty.</p>

<p>'I had my dinner before I came; but I thought
I'd like to have a smoke and a few minutes' talk
with you, Mark,' he replied.</p>

<p>'Sit thee down and have a pipe,' cried Mark
Clay.</p>

<p>'Not here,' remonstrated his brother, looking round
on the delicate brocade hangings and furniture.</p>

<p>Poor Mrs Clay did not dare to open her mouth,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
though she in her secret heart felt as indignant about
it as Mr Howroyd.</p>

<p>But Sarah had no such qualms. 'You'll have to
redecorate this room if you're going to smoke here,
and you'll have to find us another drawing-room.
Ladies don't sit in a drawing-room where men smoke,'
she said.</p>

<p>'Daughters sit where their parents tell them, if
they're worthy of the name of daughters.&mdash;But, if
you don't mind, Mark, we'll go into your study; we
can talk better alone,' said her uncle before Sarah's
father could say anything.</p>

<p>Whether motives of economy moved him, or whether
it was a certain influence which Bill Howroyd, as he
was familiarly called, had over most people, Mark
Clay got up from his seat, saying, 'Yes, we'll be
better without that pert lass's company, Bill,' and led
the way to his study.</p>

<p>'That's a blessing!' said Sarah. 'A nice state of
things it would be if father took to smoking his
horrid pipe here.'</p>

<p>'It would ruin the rose-coloured brocade, and the
curtains would smell 'orrid,' said her mother.</p>

<p>'That wouldn't be so bad as not having a single
room free from him,' said Sarah, and then added
to her brother, who got up at the time, 'Where
are you going, George?'</p>

<p>'To have a smoke,' he replied.</p>

<p>'You can smoke your cigarette here, dear; no one
would smell that,' said the fond mother.</p>

<p>'Thank you, mother; but I thought of smoking
with my father and uncle,' he replied.</p>

<p>'What! beard the lion in his den? What on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
earth for, George? You know you never do go and
smoke with him,' observed Sarah.</p>

<p>'Don't go to-night, my dear. Your uncle 'as
somethin' particular to say to 'im, an' nothin' very
pleasant, I could see that; an' you'd best not be
there in case 'e's upset. Not but w'at Bill manages
'im better than any one else; still, they'll get on
better alone.'</p>

<p>George Clay hesitated a minute, and then, turning
back, took up his old position in his armchair,
observing, 'Perhaps you're right, and I can go down
and see him to-morrow.'</p>

<p>'See whom&mdash;Uncle Howroyd?' demanded Sarah.</p>

<p>But George made no reply, and remained sunk
among the cushions, his head tilted back and his eyes
staring at the painted cupids on the ceiling, which
did not give him much pleasure, judging by the half-frown
upon his face.</p>

<p>'It's my belief that there's something the matter,'
said Sarah after a silence.</p>

<p>'Nonsense, child! W'at should be the matter?
There's always worries in business, an' women 'ave
no right to interfere in such things nor make any
remarks,' said Mrs Clay.</p>

<p>'Well, all I can say is, I wish something would
happen. We're just stalled oxen here,' observed
Sarah.</p>

<p>'Stalled oxen? W'atever can you mean?' asked
Mrs Clay in bewilderment, for she did not recognise
the allusion to the verse in Proverbs: 'Better is a
dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox and
hatred therewith.'</p>

<p>George gave a little chuckle. 'She certainly does
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
not mean what she says.&mdash;You'd better read your
Bible again, and you'll see that stalled oxen is what
we eat, not what we are.'</p>

<p>'Stalled oxen?' said Mrs Clay, repeating, as was
her custom, any remark which she did not understand
or agree with. 'Is Sarah callin' us stalled oxen?'</p>

<p>'No, I'm not, mother; I'm the only one that feels
like that. George hugs his golden chains, and so do
you,' replied Sarah. 'And he doesn't care how
doubtful the means are that give them to him.'</p>

<p>George made no reply at all, and after some time
the three got up and went to bed.</p>

<p>And so ended an evening typical of many passed
in the millionaire's house, which was only less dreary
than usual owing to William Howroyd's visit.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></h3>

<h5>AN UNANSWERED QUESTION.</h5>

<p>'It's a beautiful morning, Miss Sarah,' said Naomi,
as she pulled up the blinds in her young
mistress's room the day after the scenes
described in the foregoing chapters.</p>

<p>Naomi's rosy face was glowing with health and
happiness, and this seemed to strike Sarah, for she
said, as she looked at her, 'Is it your birthday,
Naomi?'</p>

<p>'To-day, Miss Sarah? Why, no. I was seventeen
the 1st of October. I'm a year and three months
older 'n you, miss.'</p>

<p>'What are you so pleased for, then?' she asked.</p>

<p>'I dunno as I'm more pleased than usual, unless it
be the fine weather makes one feel happy like.'</p>

<p>'It doesn't make me feel very happy; at least not
when I'm at home. I like a fine day at school,
because we can go for a long ride or walk, or play
tennis or something out of doors,' observed Sarah.</p>

<p>'And so you can do all them things here, miss;
there's horses and carriages, and motor-cars, and a
beautiful bit of grass for tennis; and if you want
a nice walk you can go over the fields and
through Brocklehurst coppice to Driffington, or by
the Dunnings to Thornborough,' said Naomi, chattering
with freedom while she prepared the bath in the
little bathroom attached to Sarah's suite of rooms.</p>

<p>Her mistress let her chatter on, and listened while
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
she gave an enthusiastic description of the lovely
country walks and rides and drives to be taken in the
immediate neighbourhood; and when the maid stopped
for a moment to take breath, Sarah remarked, 'Yes;
but I don't care to do any of these things up here. Do
you know, Naomi, when the train gets near Ousebank,
and I see its horrid high chimneys and all the air
black, I feel as if the smoke came and wrapped itself
round me and smothered me somehow, and I don't
breathe freely again till I'm in the train going back
to school.'</p>

<p>Naomi stopped short at the door of the bathroom,
her mouth wide open, and stared at her young
mistress. She said at last, 'You'll have had a nightmare,
I'll be thinking;' then, cheering up at this
explanation of Miss Sarah's unpleasant sensations,
she went on cheerfully with her preparations for her
mistress's toilet. 'And the very best thing you can do,
Miss Sarah, is to go for a lovely ride across Cowpen,
and over t' hill to Driffington. My! think of all the
lasses in the mills as 'u'd give their eyes to have the
chance! There's Liza Anne now, she'd be glad eno'
of a holiday; these bright days make her back ache
dreadful, so she says.'</p>

<p>'Liza Anne's in Clay's Mills, isn't she?' inquired
Sarah. Liza Anne was Naomi's elder sister.</p>

<p>'Yes, Miss Sarah; she's a ligger-on, is Liza Anne,
and so's Jane Mary,' explained Naomi.</p>

<p>'What's a "ligger-on," Naomi?' inquired Sarah.</p>

<p>'Why, she puts the wool on the carding-machine
and ligs it out. She's a good, steady worker is Liza
Anne.'</p>

<p>'Oh, I see; layer-on, you mean. I wish I were a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
"ligger-on," as you call it; there'd be some object to
get up for, at any rate.'</p>

<p>'You spend one day in Liza Anne's place or Jane
Mary's, and you'd talk different to that, Miss Sarah,'
said Naomi.</p>

<p>Sarah sighed impatiently. 'You all say the same
thing to me, and it's all nonsense. You're much
happier than I am; you have only to look in the
looking-glass and you'll see that, and yet you all
persist in saying that I'm happier than you.'</p>

<p>'You ought to be,' replied Naomi, as she gave a
final adjusting pat to the lace-bedecked matin&eacute;e she
had just put ready for Sarah to slip into; but she did
not attempt to argue with her mistress on a subject
which she felt, somehow, was too difficult for her.</p>

<p>Sarah dressed slowly; not that she was a deliberate
young person at all, but because she did not see any
good in making haste, as there was nothing to do,
or rather, to put it truly, as she did not care to
do anything. However, in about an hour Sarah
went downstairs dressed in a simple but fresh and
dainty print frock, and found her brother sitting at
breakfast.</p>

<p>'Morning, Sarah. What are you going to do to-day?
Anything special on?' he inquired.</p>

<p>'No; at least, I'm not going to do anything special.
I believe there's a tennis tournament on at the
Haighs'; but I don't feel inclined to go; it's going to
be hot to-day, I think.'</p>

<p>'Piping, I should say. Well, if you don't want me
to take you to the Haighs' I'll cry off myself; it's a
fearful fag playing a tournament in this weather.
Good-bye; I'm off,' he added, as he rose from the table.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
'Where are you going, George?' inquired Sarah.
'If it's anywhere nice I'll come with you.'</p>

<p>'It isn't,' he replied, and was going out of the room.</p>

<p>'Where is it?' persisted Sarah.</p>

<p>'Into Ousebank,' he replied laconically.</p>

<p>'But that is nice. Take me with you, George.'</p>

<p>'You are the most perverse girl I ever met. You
know you hate Ousebank, and yet you call it a nice
place to go for a walk,' he scoffed.</p>

<p>'It's interesting. I love to see the mills turn out
at twelve o'clock; it's like a living stream of human
beings pouring out of a lock-gate, and I love Uncle
Howroyd's mill.'</p>

<p>'Well, I sha'n't be there at twelve o'clock, so if
that's what you want to go for you'd better stay at
home,' observed her brother, who evidently was not
very anxious to take his sister with him this particular
morning, though, as a rule, he was a most good-natured
and attentive brother.</p>

<p>Sarah was quick to notice this, and being the girl
she was it made her all the more determined to go
with her brother; so she said, 'Ah, but I can go to
see Uncle Howroyd, and that's always nice. I simply
love going over the mill.'</p>

<p>'Oh!' ejaculated George, looking discomfited for a
moment; and then he apparently changed his mind,
and said, 'All right, I'll go there with you.'</p>

<p>But when they got to the door of Mr William
Howroyd's office he did not say good-bye, but was
coming in with her, when Sarah said, 'You needn't
stop for me. I may be here some time. You had
better go and do your own business, and come and
fetch me on your way back.'</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
'I think I'll come in,' said George, and in he came.</p>

<p>'Uncle Howroyd, do send George off, and say you'll
take care of me for an hour or so; he's so dreadfully
polite even to his sister that he won't leave me alone
with you,' said Sarah.</p>

<p>'Ah, but I don't know that I can take care of such
a difficult young lady,' said her uncle teasingly.</p>

<p>'But I should like to see Uncle Howroyd, too,'
objected George.</p>

<p>'That's nonsense! You've only come here to
bring me, so if you want to see him you can come
another time by yourself, not just when I'm here,'
said Sarah.</p>

<p>'I thought you wanted to see the mill?' observed
George.</p>

<p>'And I thought you came to Ousebank to do some
business?' retorted his sister.</p>

<p>'So I did.&mdash;As a matter of fact, my business was to
see you, sir,' said George, turning to his uncle, who
had been listening to this argument between the
brother and sister with his usual amused look and
twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>But when his nephew made this direct appeal to
him, Uncle Howroyd became the alert man of business,
kind and keen, and said, 'At your service, nephew.&mdash;As
for you, Sarah, if your frock isn't too fine for
going into a dirty blanket-mill, old Matthew will
take you and show you our wonderful new engine,
of which we are so proud.'</p>

<p>'I don't care twopence about your grand engine.
I hate grand new things. I'd rather go into the
old dyeing-rooms; they have such lovely new shades
every time I go,' declared Sarah.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
'There! isn't that just like a woman? Hates new
things, and wants to go into the dear old dye-rooms
to see lovely new shades!' cried her uncle.</p>

<p>Sarah only laughed, as her uncle called old Matthew,
the foreman, and told him to take Miss Clay to the
dye-rooms and show her all she wished to see, and
take care she didn't get her skirts dyed.</p>

<p>'Well, George, anything wrong?' he asked as the
door shut upon Sarah, who went off talking in a
most friendly manner with old Matthew, and the
uncle and nephew were left alone.</p>

<p>'That's what I came to you about,' said George.</p>

<p>Mr William Howroyd looked at his nephew doubtfully.
He did not understand him at any time, and
this morning the young man spoke in his usual lazy
tones, so that his uncle did not know whether George
was in any trouble or not; for, as he argued to himself,
'the boy never did show feelings, so that he might be
in love or debt or goodness knows what scrape, and
yet talk like that;' and Mr William Howroyd had a
deeply rooted conviction that all young men did at
the universities was to get into mischief of some sort.
So he said, 'Come, George, be frank with me. Have
you got into any mess? You know if you have I'll
be ready to do all I can to get you out of it.'</p>

<p>The young man looked gratefully at his uncle as
he replied in his pleasant tones, 'I'm sure you would,
uncle, and there's no one I'd sooner come to if I
wanted help; but I'm in no mess that I know of. It
was only'&mdash;he hesitated&mdash;'something in your manner
last night that made me think there was trouble at
the mill either present or looming ahead. I know
my father is not popular.'</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
Mr Howroyd looked a little surprised for a moment;
then he said cheerfully, 'Dismiss that notion from
your mind. I was a little put out last night by
something I heard, and I dare say I said all sorts of
disagreeable, sharp things; but there's no danger for
your father any more than there is for all of us.
Business is not like a profession; you gain more, but
you stand to lose more, and it's not so certain as the
law, for example. So, if you'll take my advice, you'll
go back and study hard, and have a profession at
your finger-tips; it never comes amiss to any of us,
and there's no harm done if you never follow it.'
Then he changed the conversation, and began talking
of other things, and was surprised to find what a
pleasant and intelligent companion his nephew could
be. 'Why, I'd no idea you took such an interest in
the heavy woollen trade. It's almost a pity you're
not going into it,' cried his uncle at last.</p>

<p>'But that is what I intend doing, in spite of your
advice to the contrary,' observed George quietly.</p>

<p>His uncle cast a swift look at him. 'All the same,
I should pass all my law examinations, if I were you,
in case&mdash;in case you might change your mind,' he
observed equally quietly; and then the two got up and
went across the mill-yard to the dyeing-rooms to find
Sarah, who was still there with Matthew.</p>

<p>George noticed the kindly words of greetings and
the friendly glances that passed between master
and 'hands,' as all the workers are called up
north.</p>

<p>'Now, that man's been with us thirty years; he
married his wife from here, and his family all work
for us; and this one has been fifty years, and only
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
comes once a week just to say he still works at the
old mill,' explained Mr Howroyd.</p>

<p>'That's as it should be,' said George, touching his
hat at each greeting, and raising it to an old woman
who hobbled past them.</p>

<p>His uncle smiled a little, for such courtesy is not
usual in mills, where kind hearts are hidden under
rough exteriors and blunt speech; but though the
'hands' smiled, they said to each other, after the uncle
and nephew had passed by, that 'he was a gentleman
was young Clay, and took after his uncle Howroyd
more'n his father, that was plain!'</p>

<p>'Oh uncle, why did you come so soon? I didn't
want you yet,' cried Sarah when she saw the two
at the door.</p>

<p>'Didn't you? It strikes me it's about time we did
come. My word, you've got yourself into a nice
state, my lass!' exclaimed Mr Howroyd, as well he
might, for Sarah, in her interest in the new shades,
had gone too near the huge vats and wet materials,
and her dress was the colours of the rainbow, while
her hands were a deep crimson.</p>

<p>'But just look what a lovely colour this crimson is,
George!' she exclaimed, holding up a rag which she
had dyed.</p>

<p>George contemplated his sister in silence, and then
said, 'We'd better get a taxi to go home, I think;'
and added, 'Yes, it's a pretty shade, but I think there's
a little too much blue in it to be quite becoming.'
And, turning to the dyer, he began talking pleasantly
about dyeing; and when he went away the man remarked
to Mr William Howroyd, 'He's a sharp young
gentleman is yon, and I think I'll try his advice.'</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
Meanwhile Sarah was sitting in the cab with her
brother, contemplating rather ruefully her stained
hands. 'I say, will it come off?' she inquired
anxiously.</p>

<p>'Yes, in time, if you use some acid,' replied her
brother, looking at her fingers.</p>

<p>'Oh, but I must get them clean by lunch-time, or
father will make a row,' she cried.</p>

<p>'I should advise you to have lunch in your boudoir,
as you call it. You can't possibly get all this off
at first go. I can't imagine what old Matthew
was about to let you get yourself in such a mess.
Really, you are very childish for your age, in some
ways.'</p>

<p>'What were you talking to Uncle Howroyd about?'
demanded Sarah, who did not want to talk about her
hands any longer.</p>

<p>'The heavy woollen trade,' replied her brother
promptly.</p>

<p>'That wasn't what you came down to see Uncle
Howroyd about. A lot you know of the heavy
woollen trade or any other trade! Besides, that came
out too pat. What you came down to Ousebank for
was just the same thing that I came for.'</p>

<p>'I should not have said so,' replied George dryly,
with a significant glance at her hands.</p>

<p>'It was, all the same. You came to ask Uncle
Howroyd what he meant by talking about the workhouse
last night, and so did I; but I thought one of
us was enough to ask that question, so now just tell
me what he said.'</p>

<p>If George was taken aback by her astuteness, he
did not say so, but answered simply, 'He said he did
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
not mean anything, and that there was no chance of
the workhouse for us more than for him.'</p>

<p>'Do you believe that?' asked Sarah.</p>

<p>'He said there was no more chance of our going to
the workhouse than his going there,' repeated George.</p>

<p>'Do you believe that?' repeated Sarah.</p>

<p>'No, I do not,' said George gravely.</p>

<p>'Oh George, do you think we are ruined, or anything?'
cried Sarah in excitement.</p>

<p>'Oh, do be quiet, and don't talk so loud, or the
cabby will hear you! Of course we're not ruined;
but it would never astonish me any day if we came
a howler. The pater goes too fast, and&mdash;&mdash; But
we're all right now; and, for goodness' sake, don't say
a word to mother; it would upset her dreadfully.
It's only for her sake I'd mind so much.'</p>

<p>'We'd work for her, and she'd be happier with us,
without father always shouting at her,' said Sarah.</p>

<p>'Probably we'd have to work for him too, and he
might not be angelic as a pauper,' suggested George
grimly, perhaps with a view to subdue Sarah's desire
for poverty.</p>

<p>'Oh, I never thought of that. Let's hope his
money will last as long as he lives,' she cried.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></h3>

<h5>A RELUCTANT INVITATION.</h5>

<p>'We'd better go in the back way, I think,' observed
George, tapping at the window of
the cab as he spoke and giving the order.</p>

<p>Sarah laughed, as she spread her hands out before
her and surveyed them. 'Perhaps it would be as
well, for peace' sake,' she remarked.</p>

<p>They were just getting out of the cab at the little
back-door leading into the stable-yard behind the
house, when, to their dismay, they saw Mr Mark
Clay's burly figure come with swaggering walk along
the little path through the park towards the same
door, probably coming to give some order, or more
probably, his children thought, to make himself disagreeable
to his stablemen and chauffeurs.</p>

<p>'Quick! in with you; there's the pater!' cried
George, who, polite as usual, was holding the cab-door
open for his sister.</p>

<p>Sarah needed no second bidding; but, instinctively
clutching the front breadth of her skirt in her hands
to conceal the stains, she jumped out, ran in at the
little gate, and into the house, up to her room by the
back-stairs.</p>

<p>George paid the man, who touched his hat and
drove off quickly, and the young man noticed that he
passed the owner of the park through which he
was driving without any greeting at all. George
turned to meet his father.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
The tall, slim young man, with his refined features,
looked a fit heir to the fine home, with its vast park;
but a greater contrast to the coarse man who came
towards him could not be imagined. He raised his
hat to his father, and greeted him pleasantly enough.
No one had ever heard George Clay speak otherwise
than respectfully to or of his father, in which he
compared favourably with Sarah; but if he could
civilly do so he avoided his company, and, if the
truth be known, he only spent his vacations at home
for the sake of his mother and sister. On this
occasion he could not with politeness avoid meeting
him, and did so with a good grace.</p>

<p>'Mornin', lad! Where t' been?' inquired Mark
Clay, as he gave his son a nod.</p>

<p>'Down to Ousebank, father. It's hot, isn't it?'</p>

<p>'Yes, it's fine and hot. Where's Sarah? Why
didn't she stop and say good-mornin' to her dad?
I'm not fine enough for her. I'm only good to make
money, eh?'</p>

<p>'On the contrary, it was Sarah who was not fine
enough to meet you. She stained her hands, and was
running off to wash them,' said George.</p>

<p>'Stained her hands! What did she stain her hands
for? I won't have her pretty hands soiled; there's
no call for her ever to do aught with them but fancy
work.'</p>

<p>'Sarah isn't fond of fancy work,' observed George,
avoiding a direct answer.</p>

<p>'I don't know what she is fond of, without it's
cheekin' me. What do you think she said yesterday?
That I was no better than a murderer because I didn't
pay a man his high wages when he got too old to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
work. A nice thing it would be if I had to keep all
my sick workmen in luxury, and pay some one else
for doing their work. It wasn't by such means that
I built this house, I can tell 'e.' Mark Clay spoke
broader Yorkshire than many of his men, and even
he could speak, and did speak, better English when
he chose; in fact, it was only when he was annoyed
or angry that he broke out into dialect.</p>

<p>Sarah ran to her room and plunged her hands into
hot water, but, as might have been expected, without
any effect; and when the lunch-gong sounded they
were still far too brilliant to bear her father's scrutiny.
So she rang for Naomi, and said, 'Just tell Sykes
to send up some lunch to me, Naomi; and if any one
asks where I am, tell them I am very busy. So I am,
cleaning my hands; though you needn't tell them
that.'</p>

<p>Naomi went off to do her young mistress's bidding,
but came back in ten minutes looking very grave,
and said, 'Please, Miss Sarah, the master says as 'ow
it don't matter about your hands, and you can go down
to lunch with them as they are.'</p>

<p>Sarah stamped her foot with vexation. 'I told
you not to say anything about my hands, Naomi.'</p>

<p>'No more I didn't; but the master knew, for he
told Mr Sykes to give me that message for you.
And please, miss, excuse me saying so, but Sykes he
said, "Try and make Miss Sarah come down, for
master he gets into such a taking if he's crossed;"
and Sykes he says'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'Never mind what Sykes said. Get me out my
pink muslin,' said Sarah shortly, with her most
haughty air, and Naomi obeyed in silence.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
Sarah's frock was not pinker than her face when
she got to the dining-room.</p>

<p>'So you've been to Howroyd's Mill messing with
his dyes, have you? What do you want to go there
for when you could come to mine, eh? What did
you go to him for, and what did he say?' her father
asked suspiciously.</p>

<p>'Nothing very interesting; at least I don't remember
anything. Oh yes; he said hands weren't money-making
machines, but human souls which had to be
cared for,' replied Sarah.</p>

<p>'I don't mean that kind of talk. Did he talk
business, eh?' inquired Mr Clay.</p>

<p>'Oh dear no; he never does to me,' she answered.</p>

<p>'Not been croaking, has he?' the millionaire asked
with hidden anxiety.</p>

<p>This time it was George who spoke, inquiring,
'Is there anything to croak about, then?'</p>

<p>'I want an answer to my question, and, by gad, I'll
have it!' exclaimed his father, bringing his fist down
on the table with a crash.</p>

<p>'No; he was very cheerful, as he always is. And
now, sir, perhaps you will be good enough to answer
my question,' said George, who spoke very quietly
but decidedly.</p>

<p>Sarah gave her brother an approving look.</p>

<p>'What question? Oh, whether there's anything
to croak about?  Not in my opinion; but your
uncle&mdash;&mdash; But there, it's no good taking any notice
of him. He'd build a palace for his hands to work
in and live in, and stop in that old mill all his life,
would Bill Howroyd,' replied Mr Clay; and, frowning
heavily, the millionaire got up from the table.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
'I say, mother, would you mind if I went for a
week's shooting to Scotland?' inquired her son.</p>

<p>'No, dearie; no. You go; it'll do you good. I
suppose it's some o' your college friends as 'ave asked
you? Yes, you go; there's nothin' for you to do
'ere,' said the fond mother.</p>

<p>'And what about me? What am I to do if you go
off and leave me all alone? I shall go melancholy
mad in this hole of a place!' cried Sarah.</p>

<p>''Ole!&mdash;w'en it's on the top o' a 'ill! W'at silly
nonsense you do talk, child! 'Ole, indeed!' said Mrs
Clay.</p>

<p>'It is rather rough luck to leave you in your
holidays; but Cockburn has asked me so often.
Couldn't you ask some one to stay with you&mdash;one of
your schoolfellows, perhaps?' George suggested.</p>

<p>'Nice, comfortable house this is to ask any one to
stay in!' said Sarah sarcastically.</p>

<p>'It's as comfortable as any o' theirs, if it isn't a
great deal better,' cried her mother.</p>

<p>'I'd sooner live in Naomi's home if I'd my choice,'
said Sarah gloomily.</p>

<p>'Sarah is right in one way, mother,' said George
before Mrs Clay could say anything. 'It is not very
comfortable to have constant disturbances in one's
home; and the governor is very easily angered.'</p>

<p>'Yes, dear, I know,' agreed Mrs Clay, who adored
her son, and thought everything he did or said perfection.
'An' it's 'ard for you an' Sarah, for you
don't understan' your father, nor ain't used to 'im as
I am. But that's not a bad idea o' yours that Sarah
should ask one o' the young ladies at 'er school to
come an' stay 'ere for a bit.&mdash;There's that Miss
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
Cunning'am that you've got the photograph o' in
your room. She's got a nice, 'omely face.'</p>

<p>'She's a duke's granddaughter, whether her face
is homely or not. No, I couldn't ask her,' declared
Sarah.</p>

<p>'Why not? She'd be the very one. Your father
likes people o' 'igh class, though 'e was only a mill-'and
'isself. An' she's got such a nice smile on 'er
photo,' persisted the mother.</p>

<p>'I couldn't possibly ask her; she'd never come
and stay with a manufacturer,' declared Sarah
again.</p>

<p>'I'd be bound she'd jump at it. She'd not get a
better dinner at 'ome or anyw'ere, nor a better room
to sleep in,' said Mrs Clay.</p>

<p>This remark grated upon both her children, as so
many of poor Mrs Clay's sayings did; but George,
tactful as usual, remarked, 'Suppose you write and
ask Miss Cunningham, Sarah; and if she is too proud
to visit a maker of blankets, why, she will refuse,
and there will be the end of it; and if she accepts,
it will show that her friendship for you is stronger
than class prejudices.'</p>

<p>Sarah looked at her brother for a minute as if she
wanted to say something, but did not do so, and only
drummed with her crimson-dyed fingers on the white
table-cloth, taking apparently great delight in their
appearance.</p>

<p>'Yes; you do as your brother tells you, instead of
sittin' there smilin' at them dreadful 'ands o' yours.
I'm sure they're nothin' to be proud o'. Now, if
you lived in Howroyd's Mill, w'ere your uncle Bill
lives, you might be ashamed to ask the young lady
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
to stay wi' you; but 'ere it's quite different,' said
Mrs Clay.</p>

<p>The brother and sister, it will have been noticed,
always called their father's step-brother Uncle
Howroyd, whereas their mother and father called
him Bill or 'your uncle Bill.' The fact was that the
younger people did not like 'Bill,' and George said
he was thankful for one thing, and that was that his
name could not be shortened; while Sarah had made
violent protests against being called Sally or Sal, and
would not allow any one except her father, whom she
could not control, to call her anything but Sarah;
and, indeed, the latter name suited her best.</p>

<p>Sarah followed her brother into his smoking-den.
'Pshaw! What a stuffy room!' she exclaimed, as she
threw herself upon the cushioned window-seat.</p>

<p>'If it does not please you I fail to see why you
have come into it; and as for being stuffy'&mdash;&mdash;
Instead of completing his sentence George shrugged
his shoulders, as much as to say the accusation was
too absurd to be argued about.</p>

<p>'It <i>is</i> stuffy, with all those cushions and carpets
about, and pictures and gimcracks, for all its big
windows. I can't think how you like to stuff it up
with all this rubbish,' persisted Sarah.</p>

<p>'This rubbish, as you call it, is worth a pretty
penny,' he remarked, lighting a cigarette.</p>

<p>'You're as bad as father, counting everything by
what it costs. But, I say, George, why did you go
and suggest my inviting Horatia Cunningham to come
and stay here? I don't want her; and now you've
started mother on it she'll give me no peace till I do
ask her, and very likely say something to father,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
and he'll begin worrying about it, especially if
he hears she's a duke's granddaughter. Besides,
she wouldn't come if I did ask her,' Sarah remarked.</p>

<p>'In that case there'll be no harm done if you do
ask her. But I can't imagine why you shouldn't;
she looks a very nice girl, and you are great friends,
aren't you? And what has her grandfather to do
with it?' asked George.</p>

<p>'At school we are; but whether we should be after
she'd been up here isn't so certain. And as for why
I shouldn't ask her, the reason is pretty plain&mdash;father,'
replied Sarah.</p>

<p>'You mean he might make himself unpleasant?'
suggested George.</p>

<p>'There's no need for him to <i>make</i> himself; Nature
has made him unpleasant,' exclaimed Sarah.</p>

<p>'You need not see much of him. You can go for
picnics or drives, and arrange to have lunch earlier
or later; and you never breakfast and have tea
with him, so it's only at dinner-time that they will
meet. I should not think he will get into a rage
before a stranger, especially a young girl.'</p>

<p>Sarah seemed to be considering something, and
suddenly she blurted out, 'It isn't only that. I don't
want her to come here; can't you see why not?
They don't know what my people are. Oh, they
know we're manufacturers; but that's nothing to be
ashamed of. Lots of manufacturers are gentlemen,
but we are not gentlefolks, and they&mdash;they don't
guess it from me,' she wound up half-shamefacedly.</p>

<p>'Then I wouldn't sail under false colours. We are
risen from the people, and our parents have not had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
the education they have been good enough to give us;
but it would be contemptible to be ashamed of the
fact or of them.'</p>

<p>'That's very fine and high-flown; but I am ashamed
of my father, at any rate. I'd rather not have
Horatia Cunningham come here and laugh at my
mother behind her back,' said Sarah.</p>

<p>'I should like to see any one dare to do that,' said
George, with an angrier look than his sister had ever
seen him give.</p>

<p>'She wouldn't mean it nastily; but it's no good
pretending that mother does not say the wrong thing
sometimes,' said Sarah.</p>

<p>'The wrong thing has been sending you to that
school,' said George, his loyalty and love for his
mother preventing his acknowledging the truth of
this remark; and then he said more kindly, for he
sympathised more with his sister than he chose to
say, 'I don't believe Miss Cunningham would be
nasty in any way. I know her brother slightly at
college, and he is "Hail, fellow! well met," with
every chap he meets. You take my advice, and
write and ask her to come here. You can tell her,
if you like, that&mdash;well, that we are <i>nouveaux riches</i>,
and have no pretensions of being gentlefolks; but
that she will have a hearty Yorkshire welcome, and
that's not a thing to be despised, let me tell you.
Here, sit down and write the letter at once. I shall
enjoy myself much more in Scotland if I know you
have a companion.'</p>

<p>'I shouldn't mind so much if you were going to be
at home,' said Sarah, only half-won over.</p>

<p>George ignored the implied compliment, and said,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
'You will get on much better alone. Sit down and
write the invitation here. I'll help you.'</p>

<p>'No, thank you; I'd rather write my own way,'
remarked Sarah, as she rose from the window-seat.
When she got to the door, she turned back to say, 'I
have a presentiment that she'll accept, and it will
be all your fault, remember. Whatever the consequences,
they will be on your head.'</p>

<p>George only laughed, and sat down himself to
accept his shooting invitation.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></h3>

<h5>AN EXTRAORDINARY LETTER.</h5>

<p>It did not take George Clay five minutes to write
his acceptance of his friend's invitation; but his
sister did not find her letter quite so easy to
write, and she sat at the pretty Chippendale table
biting the end of her pen for more than that length
of time before she began to write in desperation, only
to tear up the letter in despair.</p>

<p>'It's all very well for George to talk; but it's not so
easy to sit down and tell a girl you are not a lady,
and, what's more, that your parents are not gentlefolks,'
said Sarah aloud to herself.</p>

<p>Then she started again, and wrote a friendly invitation,
without any embarrassing explanations or
apologies.</p>

<p>'George may be able to say that kind of thing in a
gentlemanly way&mdash;he always does say the right sort
of thing&mdash;but I shall just chance it,' she muttered to
herself, as she sealed up the letter and sent it off by
Naomi, without showing it to any one or taking
any one's advice upon it. To have done so would have
been quite contrary to Sarah's habits, for she was of a
very independent character, and the circumstances of
her whole life no doubt fostered this characteristic.</p>

<p>'So we've got a grand young lady from London
coming up to stay with us plain folk,' said Mr Mark
Clay when he saw his daughter at dinner that evening.</p>

<p>'I've asked one of my schoolfellows to come to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
stay with me; but I don't know that she will come,
and I don't know that you will think her grand. She
dresses very plainly,' replied Sarah.</p>

<p>'Then she'll be all the more willing to come if she's
poor,' said Mr Clay.</p>

<p>'She's not in the least poor. It's not the fashion
for schoolgirls to dress very grandly,' said Sarah
hastily.</p>

<p>'Nonsense! People dress as they can afford; and,
I'll be bound, I could buy up her father twice over,'
said Mark Clay in his boastful way.</p>

<p>Sarah's lips curled scornfully. 'You couldn't buy
his rank. I hope to goodness she won't come,' she
said.</p>

<p>No notice was taken of this remark, which was put
down to Sarah's contradictoriness, and no one knew
how heartily the girl repented of her invitation.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Horatia Cunningham opened the letter
from her friend, without in the least expecting it to
contain an invitation to visit the schoolfellow whom
they all talked of as the millionaire's daughter. Great
was her surprise on reading it, for Sarah never talked
at school of her people or her home, and the girls
vaguely imagined that she was unhappy in her home.</p>

<p>'Mamma, just listen to this letter,' Horatia cried, as
she read the letter aloud at the breakfast-table:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'"<span class="smcap">Dear Horatia</span>,&mdash;Will you come and spend as
much of the holidays as you can spare with me? We
live on a hill outside Ousebank, so that you will not
be in a manufacturing town, and we can go for plenty
of walks or rides and drives and play tennis as much
as you like. I shall be all alone, as my brother
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
is going to stay with friends in Scotland.&mdash;Your
affectionate friend,       <span class="smcap">Sarah Clay</span>."'</p></div>

<p>'What an extraordinary letter! She is not gushing,'
said Lady Grace Cunningham, as she continued to
pour out the coffee.</p>

<p>'Is she an orphan, and what does she mean by
being all alone? Has she no guardian or chaperon?'
inquired Horatia's father.</p>

<p>'She has a father and a mother. She is the
daughter of a millionaire blanket-maker named Clay.'</p>

<p>'I believe I've heard the name; but I don't know
what I've heard of him,' said Mr Cunningham.</p>

<p>'That would account for her odd way of writing,'
said his wife.</p>

<p>'What is odd about it?' demanded Horatia.</p>

<p>'Her writing without mentioning her mother's
name, and she never says she would like to see you.
Besides, to begin with, as a matter of politeness,
Mrs Clay should have written to me,' objected Lady
Grace Cunningham.</p>

<p>'Sarah is very independent, and I expect she does
as she likes at home,' said Horatia. 'But she is a
very nice girl, mamma, and I may go, mayn't I?' she
begged.</p>

<p>'Do you really want to go? You know these
people, though they have great riches, are very often
very unrefined. What is the girl like?'</p>

<p>'I'll show you her photograph, and she looks like
a queen when she walks,' said Horatia; and in her
eagerness to get leave to pay the visit she ran upstairs
to fetch the photo, and came back with a portrait of
a boy and girl.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
'Dear me, what a handsome couple!' exclaimed
Lady Grace Cunningham; 'and most refined,' she
added, as she passed the photo to her husband for
his inspection and opinion.</p>

<p>'A very fine face&mdash;the girl's, I mean; the young
fellow looks rather effeminate. I don't think you'd
learn anything but good from that girl; but she looks
proud. I should never have taken her for a tradesman's
daughter,' he remarked, as he put the photo
down.</p>

<p>'She is not. He is a manufacturer,' protested
Horatia.</p>

<p>'Some of our merchants are of good old stock, and
as refined as ourselves, if I may be allowed that piece
of boasting,' replied his wife.</p>

<p>'And no doubt these people are. Well, personally,
I have no objection to Horatia's going to them, if you
have not,' said Mr Cunningham; and he buried himself
in his newspaper.</p>

<p>'Hurrah!' cried Horatia, clapping her hands.</p>

<p>'Why this excitement? Are you so fond of this
schoolfellow, or do you find home dull?' inquired
Lady Grace Cunningham.</p>

<p>'Oh no, mamma; of course I am never dull at The
Grange, and I don't know that I am so fond of Sarah.
I do like her very much, but I shall see her in another
month; so, if you like, I will write and refuse the
invitation.'</p>

<p>'By no means. I wish you to grow up large-minded;
but you have not explained why you were
so delighted at the thought of going to spend a month
with these strangers. I don't suppose their riches
attract you.'</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
'Oh no; I don't think one could have a nicer home
than this. I believe the real truth is that I should
like to see a mill. I read a story about mill-girls
once; how they wore pattens on their feet and shawls
on their heads, and talked so broadly that you
couldn't understand them, and threw mud at strangers.
I would like'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'To have mud thrown at you?' exclaimed her
mother. 'Well, there's no accounting for tastes!'</p>

<p>Horatia gave a merry laugh, such an infectious
laugh that both her mother and father joined in it.</p>

<p>'No; I should keep out of their way, and look at
them through a window,' she remarked.</p>

<p>'Perhaps they'd throw a stone through the window
and break it,' observed Horatia's practical
sister.</p>

<p>'Well, I promise to duck my head if I see one
coming,' she assured them, laughing.</p>

<p>'I don't suppose there will be any need. I fancy
mill-hands, as I believe they call them, are very much
civilised, and dress quite grandly now,' said her
mother.</p>

<p>'Oh, I hope not! I shall be disappointed if they
do,' cried Horatia.</p>

<p>Thus it came about that two mornings after she
had despatched her letter Sarah had an answer from
Horatia Cunningham, accepting her friend's kind
invitation with pleasure, and announcing her arrival
at the end of the week.</p>

<p>'So you were right, and she is coming,' Sarah said
gloomily to her brother, as she twisted the letter in
her fingers.</p>

<p>'That's very nice. You must think of nice expeditions
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
to take her. There is lovely scenery within
reach, especially if she's fond of motoring,' he said.</p>

<p>'I wish to goodness the visit were over. I have a
presentiment that it will be a failure,' his sister
persisted.</p>

<p>'Don't be absurd! It won't be a failure if you
try to make it a success; and, if you don't mind my
giving you a hint, be civil to the governor before
Miss Cunningham, at all events; it's such bad form
not to be, you know,' said George.</p>

<p>'I wish you'd give the governor, as you call him,
a hint or two. He's the one who'll make the visit a
failure, if it is one. Well, she's going to come, so it's
no use groaning about it now,' said Sarah.</p>

<p>'Now, Sally, what are you looking so glum about?
I suppose you don't think we're grand enough for
your duchess-friend? Never you mind, we'll put our
best foot forward. She shall have the royal suite of
rooms. I've made up my mind to do the thing handsome,'
said Mr Clay.</p>

<p>'Oh Mark, that is good o' you! I 'ope the young
lady won't spoil 'em,' said his wife.</p>

<p>The royal suite of rooms, it should be explained,
consisted of a bedroom, anteroom, sitting-room, and
bathroom, which had been so sumptuously decorated
that the workmen called them the 'royal suite;' and
Mr Clay, overhearing them, had said the royal suite
they should be called. Perhaps it would be prophetic,
for stranger things had to come to pass than royalty
coming to stay with the Mayor of Ousebank, as he
had been, and probably would be again.</p>

<p>Sarah knew she ought to express her gratitude to
her father for the honour he was showing to her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
friend; but no words would come. Sarah Clay was,
unfortunately, more in the habit of uttering unpleasant
truths than making pretty speeches to her father;
and, if the truth be told, she was not altogether
pleased at the honour shown, for the rooms were not
very suitable for a young girl, and Sarah had an
idea that the grandeur would be wasted on Horatia,
who, she suspected, would rather have a room near
hers.</p>

<p>George, as usual, came to the rescue. 'That is very
kind of you, father; but perhaps, as Miss Cunningham
is very young, and is coming for the first time among
strangers, she would prefer to be in the west wing
near some one she knows. There's the anteroom,
next Sarah's; that is very pretty for a girl, and they
could share the boudoir.'</p>

<p>Sarah shot a grateful look at her brother; but his
pains were thrown away, for Mr Clay, who was not
a man to be easily turned from his plan, said, 'She'll
soon get used to us, and she can have her maid to
sleep next door. No; I've promised she shall have
the royal rooms, and I'll not go back on my word.'</p>

<p>'Let's hope she'll appreciate them,' said George in
a non-committal tone.</p>

<p>Sarah spent the intervening two or three days in
a state of suppressed excitement and unsuppressed
irritability; and George at last began to regret, like
herself, that her friend was coming, and was sorry
for having made the suggestion. He would even
have given up his visit to the north if Sarah had accepted
his sacrifice; but the latter declared brusquely,
'You couldn't do much good; and, considering that my
excuse for asking her here was that I should be alone,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
it would look rather odd if you didn't go away, after
all.'</p>

<p>So George went off, his parting words to Sarah
being, 'Don't worry. Just be as nice to her as you
can, and don't, for goodness' sake, be ashamed of being
what you are, for you have nothing to be ashamed
of.'</p>

<p>'I don't think that,' said Sarah.</p>

<p>'We need be ashamed of nothing in this world
except doing wrong,' said George; and the motor
started with a hoot of approval of this worthy sentiment.</p>

<p>Sarah waved her hand to her brother, and stood
watching him until the motor was hidden behind the
trees and a bend in a long avenue, and then turned
back to the house, her head bent towards the gravel-path,
the pebbles of which she kicked with her feet,
to the distinct disapproval of the young gardener
who had just rolled it, and viewed this destruction of
his work from a distance.</p>

<p>'Ashamed of nothing but doing wrong!' she soliloquised.
'That's not true. One is ashamed of having
dirty hands or muddy boots; there's nothing wrong
in that.' She turned impulsively as if to say this to
her brother, and have the last word; but that being
an impossibility, she was reduced to arguing the
question out with herself, as Sarah had a habit of
doing.</p>

<p>The only person she ever consulted, or whose advice
or criticism she accepted, was her uncle Howroyd.
But this question she could not ask him, for Sarah
hardly liked to own to herself that she was a little
ashamed of her uncle Howroyd; at least, not exactly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
ashamed, but she did not mean to take Horatia
Cunningham to see him or the old-fashioned mill-house
in which William Howroyd and his father had
lived for three or four generations.</p>

<p>So Sarah was reduced to herself as an authority
upon this question for the present, and not being by
any means a safe authority, she did not get a wise
answer, which might have saved her a great deal of
vexation and annoyance; for Sarah decided that
George was quite wrong. There were things which
were not wrong, and yet one could not help being
ashamed of them; and one thing Sarah was
ashamed of was having parents who were not only
uneducated, but had unrefined ideas.</p>

<p>Sarah had one day-dream, absurd as it may seem, of
which she never spoke. Sarah always cherished the
hope that she might some day find that she and her
brother were not really George and Sarah Clay, but
adopted children of Mark Clay, and that by-and-by
the news would be broken to them. And yet Sarah
was a well-educated, intelligent girl of sixteen, and
lived in the twentieth century. The fancy arose from
a remark her father once made when she was quite a
child: 'They are not my children; they are a cut
above me. They've got their mother's features, but
they'll have nothing of me but my money.' And
upon this half-bitter, half-proud speech of Mark
Clay's Sarah built her romance, which varied as she
invented different explanations of the mystery from
time to time; but her favourite one was that her
mother first married a lord who was ashamed of his
wife, and would not acknowledge his children until
they were grown up and properly educated; and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
Sarah used to picture the reconciliation between them
and their proud relatives, for whose benefit she composed
many fine speeches full of reproof and final
forgiveness.</p>

<p>This may be a little excuse for her want of respect
to her father, Mark Clay, by speaking of whom, it will
be remembered, as 'your husband' she used to anger
her mother. She even half-thought of telling Horatia
this tale; but Horatia had a way of turning everything
into ridicule, and one of the many things that
Sarah could not stand was being laughed at.</p>

<p>The same motor that took George Clay to the station
took Sarah that afternoon to meet Horatia Cunningham,
who was to arrive at six o'clock, and who persisted
in arriving at that hour, although Sarah had
written to her and warned her it was the hour when
the mill-hands came out; she said she did not mind
at all, and supposed that she would be quite safe in a
motor with its smart chauffeur; and Sarah, looking
so fresh and dainty that many a one turned and
looked after the millionaire's pretty daughter, started
off for the station, and not one of them guessed she
was feeling nervous, and wished with all her might
that she were going on another errand. The girl
even wished that something might have happened to
prevent her friend from coming; but when the train
stopped she saw the wish was vain, for Horatia's
face was smiling at her from a window, and Sarah
forgot her fears for the moment, and smiled back a
welcome.</p>

<h5>HORATIA'S ARRIVAL.</h5>

<p>Sarah stepped forward to help Horatia down
from the carriage, and suddenly her expression
changed to one of mingled surprise and annoyance;
seeing which, the young visitor, with a merry
laugh, jumped from the carriage to the platform,
ignoring the steps and Sarah's outstretched hand.</p>

<p>'There! I said so, didn't I, Nanny?' she cried,
turning to her maid, a highly respectable, middle-aged
woman, with as good-humoured a face as her young
charge.&mdash;'Sarah, I said the minute you saw us come
out of a third-class carriage you would put on that
shocked face of yours. That's partly why I did it.'</p>

<p>'You must excuse Miss Horatia, miss. She's full
of mischief, and she got into this carriage at the
junction without my seeing what class it was, or I
would never have allowed her to do such a thing as
arrive here third, with you to meet her, and the
"chauffer" and all,' said Horatia's maid.</p>

<p>'Oh, bother the chauffeur! It's nothing to do with
him which class I travel!' exclaimed Horatia, who, to
do her justice, had no idea that the chauffeur was just
behind her. That individual was far too well trained
to give any sign of having heard this remark, though it
was very different from the way his present employers
treated him. Mark Clay bullied his servants, and
his timid little wife hardly dared to speak to them.
Sarah was very reserved, except with Naomi; while
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
George was as courteous to a beggar as to a lord,
having but one manner with them all.</p>

<p>When Horatia saw what she had done she made a
funny little face, and said in an undertone to Sarah,
'I say, Sarah, can't we walk to your house?'</p>

<p>'I don't think we had better. We shall meet the
mill-hands coming out, and mother does not like us
to do that,' said Sarah.</p>

<p>'Oh, of course, if your mother does not allow it, we
can't; but do you think I had better apologise to your
man?' she suggested.</p>

<p>'Apologise? Pray, don't think of such a thing!
But I suppose you are only saying that to shock me,
though why that should amuse you so much I can't
think,' observed Sarah.</p>

<p>'You would if you could see your own face; but I
really didn't get into that railway-carriage only to
shock you. I got in to hear Yorkshire people talk.
I saw some country men and women get in, and I just
followed them; and, oh Sarah, what does "ginnel"
mean, and a "fettle"?'</p>

<p>'I don't know what a "ginnel" is; but "fettle" is a
verb. A fettler is the man who cleans the machines
in the mill. I have heard the people here talk of
"fettling" the hearth when they mean "clean up."
And old Matthew, a mill-hand, said the other day he
didn't feel in a grand fettle. I suppose he meant
"well."'</p>

<p>'A ginnel's a narrow passage, miss. Yon's a ginnel
we are just passing,' said the chauffeur to Horatia,
slowing down as they passed what is generally called
an alley, to which he pointed.</p>

<p>'Oh, thank you very much,' said Horatia genially,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
and added to Sarah, as she squeezed her arm, 'Oh
Sarah, I am enjoying myself so much!'</p>

<p>Her happiness was infectious, and Sarah turned to
her visitor with an amused smile. 'Why, what can
you find to enjoy already?' she asked, with some
reason, for they were going almost at walking pace
through the town, because of the crowds that poured
into the streets from almost every side-turning, so
that it could not be the exhilarating motion of motoring
that she liked so much.</p>

<p>'Everything! Seeing all those people and hearing
people talk Yorkshire,' cried Horatia.</p>

<p>'The people are just like poor people anywhere,
only rather dirtier; and I don't like their way of
speaking&mdash;they have such rough, loud voices,' replied
Sarah.</p>

<p>'I think that kind of sing-song they have is
musical, and they are not a bit like our villagers; I
don't know how, but they are not,' said Horatia,
glancing about her, and almost jumping up and down
in her eagerness to see all there was to be seen, as they
drove slowly along the narrow, and at this time
crowded, streets of the grimy manufacturing town.</p>

<p>'Oh, oh, look, Nanny, at that lovely river all
purple!' she cried enthusiastically.</p>

<p>'Well, really, Miss Horatia, I can't say that I do
admire that. It looks shocking dirty,' said the maid.</p>

<p>'It is. It's lovely before it gets to Ousebank; but
it's so polluted by the mills turning all their horrid
dyes and things into it that fish can't live in it,'
observed Sarah in tones of disgust.</p>

<p>'Well, I call it a lovely colour. Just think how
delightful&mdash;when you get tired of a dress one colour,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
you have just got to dip it into the river when the
water's the colour you want, and, hey, presto! there
you are with a new dress!'</p>

<p>Even the chauffeur on the seat in front let his face
relax into a smile at Horatia's chatter; but Sarah,
though she laughed, said decidedly, 'I'd rather send
my dresses to proper dyers than put them into that
dirty water; and I'd rather see the river clean, and
so would you if you lived here.'</p>

<p>They had got clear of the town now, and Horatia,
having nothing to look at except an ugly row of
cottages, in which even she could not find anything
to admire, turned her attention to the car, which she
declared most luxurious, and ever so much better
than her father's.</p>

<p>'We can go out in it as much as you like, if you
like motoring, and go for picnics in the country,' suggested
Sarah.</p>

<p>'That will be very nice; but I want to see your
mill first,' said Horatia. 'Is it near the house?'</p>

<p>'No; we passed it just now, when you said,
"What a big stream of people!"' answered Sarah.</p>

<p>'But they didn't know you,' objected the other.</p>

<p>'Oh yes, they did&mdash;by sight, I mean. But what
difference would that make? You don't expect them
to nod to me, do you?'</p>

<p>'All our villagers do to me, even though I don't
know them by sight,' said Horatia.</p>

<p>'Then they are different from our people, and
perhaps there are not so many. We have over eight
hundred men in our mill, besides women and boys.'</p>

<p>Horatia began to see that Sarah did not care to
talk about mill-people, as she called them in her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
mind, and as they entered the park at the moment,
and the house in another moment, she found other
subjects for conversation.</p>

<p>Horatia was a year younger than Sarah and more
than a head shorter, and a greater contrast than the
two presented could not be imagined: the one tall,
slender, dignified, with regular features and clear
complexion; and the other short, square-set, with
snub-nose and freckled skin, a face only redeemed
from plainness by its merry, twinkling eyes and good-humoured
mouth, which was always broadening into
a smile.</p>

<p>Mrs Clay had seen Horatia Cunningham's photograph,
so that she was prepared for a girl with a
homely face; but most photographs flatter, and Mrs
Clay had not expected to see any one quite so ordinary
in appearance, 'an' that plainly dressed,' as she confided
to her husband. However, she came forward
with a hearty welcome, and as soon as Horatia smiled
at her she forgot the slight shock her young guest's
appearance had given her.</p>

<p>Horatia jumped out of the car as she had jumped
out of the train. 'It is so kind of you to have me;
and what a lovely view you have! One would never
think the town was so near. I suppose it is hidden
behind those trees?' she said.</p>

<p>'No, my dear&mdash;Miss Cunningham, I mean&mdash;the
town is be'ind the 'ouse. My 'usband built the
mansion this way on purpose,' said Mrs Clay, in her
nervousness dropping the <i>h's</i> more than usual.</p>

<p>Sarah kept a keen eye upon Horatia during this
speech. She had been dreading this moment, and had
only forgotten her anxiety, thanks to Horatia's free
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
praise of all she saw; but not a trace of mockery
could she see in her schoolfellow's smile; in fact,
Horatia was more polite than she was to the teachers
at school, to whom they were expected to be most
courteous. 'I suppose she didn't expect her to be
educated,' thought Sarah, a little bitterly.</p>

<p>But she did her school friend an injustice, for Mrs
Clay was a far greater shock to Horatia than she was
to her hostess; and it said much for the girl's innate
good-breeding that she showed no sign of the fact,
but only answered frankly, 'Please don't call me Miss
Cunningham. I'm not grown up yet, and my name is
Horatia.' And here the thought came into Horatia's
mind that she would certainly be ''Oratia' to her
hostess, and she felt a wild desire to laugh, but
valiantly repressed it; for which she was very thankful
when Mrs Clay, with a pretty, pink colour in her
delicate, faded cheeks, said, 'Thank you, my dear; it's
a very pretty name, but it's difficult to remember. I
expect I shall always call you "my dear," as you don't
mind, and I am sure you are a very dear young lady.'</p>

<p>Horatia impulsively threw her arms round Mrs
Clay's neck, and, kissing her, said, 'I am sure I am
going to have a lovely time here, and I think it's
awfully good of you to ask me.'</p>

<p>Mrs Clay beamed with delight, and all fears on
her part that the visit would not be a success were
over.</p>

<p>Sarah's brow cleared. She was rather surprised
that Horatia and her mother had taken to each other;
but so far so well. The worst was&mdash;her father; and
Sarah almost longed for dinner-time, so that that
meeting also should be over. 'She won't like him, I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
know,' she murmured, with a recollection of a scene at
school when a visitor had been presuming in Horatia's
opinion, and she had rather surprised her companions
by the frigid air she assumed. 'He'll offend her, and
she will say something, and, oh dear! I'm sure there
will be a scene,' sighed Sarah.</p>

<p>However, dinner was two hours off, and Sarah took
Horatia through the vast corridors and up to the
royal rooms, followed by Horatia's old nurse, who had
come in the capacity of maid, and was by her mistress's
orders keeping near her charge till she settled
down in her new surroundings.</p>

<p>Horatia and her maid were both used to large
houses, and had stayed at the ducal mansion of
Horatia's relative; but when the door leading into
the royal rooms was opened she gave a cry of admiration.
'But am I to sleep here? It's far too grand
for me, Sarah. And what a big room! I shall lose
myself in it!' she cried.</p>

<p>'My father wished you to have these rooms.
There's a bed for your maid next door, in the dressing-room.
My mother thought you might be nervous
in a new house,' explained Sarah.</p>

<p>'How kind you all are! Fancy taking all that
trouble about making me comfortable! I'm afraid I
sha'n't be able to give you such a lot of rooms when
you come to stay with us,' said Horatia, as she
wandered from room to room, and stopped first to
admire the writing-table with gold everything, and
finally the bathroom with silver fittings.</p>

<p>'I will leave you to rest a little, and when you are
ready for a walk in the park, please ring the bell and
Naomi will fetch me,' said Sarah as she went off,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
relieved to find that Horatia took everything in a
friendly spirit.</p>

<p>'Oh Miss Horatia, this is a funny house!' exclaimed
Horatia's nurse.</p>

<p>'I don't see anything funny in it,' said Horatia;
'it's a very beautiful one.'</p>

<p>'Yes, miss, it is that; these people must have a
mint of money. Why, look at these rooms; they're
fit for a king. And to think that poor thing is the
mistress of it all. She doesn't look hardly fit,' said
the woman.</p>

<p>Horatia let this remark pass in silence; but if her
loyalty to her hostess had let her she would probably
have agreed with her nurse, for she did feel, somehow,
as Sarah did, that it was all too grand, and oppressed
her somehow. 'My dresses are not grand enough for
these rooms, Nanny, or for this house,' she replied.</p>

<p>But this was too much for the old nurse. 'You'll
look a lady and be a lady in the commonest of them,
and that's more than these Clays be, for all their
money,' she cried indignantly.</p>

<p>'That isn't very nice of you when they are so kind
to us, Nanny, and have asked us here so that we may
enjoy ourselves,' said Horatia reproachfully.</p>

<p>'No, Miss Horatia, it isn't, and I ought to be
ashamed of myself that you have to teach me my
duty instead of me showing you a good example;
but I felt wild to think of them, perhaps, thinking
themselves better than you because they have such a
lot of money out of blankets,' said the good woman.
'Why, I'd sooner have The Grange than this house
any day.'</p>

<p>'So would I, of course, because it's my home; but
I wouldn't mind having a bathroom like this, all
marble and silver, and all those lovely little contrivances
to wash yourself without any trouble; and I
will some day, when I'm rich,' declared Horatia.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>And now, being ready for dinner, Horatia rang for
Sarah, and the two went down to the painted and
gilded drawing-room to wait till the gong sounded,
which it presently did, and the three went into the
dining-room, where they found Mr Mark Clay, as
was his custom, seated at the table.</p>

<p>When they arrived, Mrs Clay, whose duty it was to
introduce Horatia to her host, left that duty to Sarah,
and Sarah left it to her mother, with the result that
no one performed that ceremony.</p>

<p>Horatia had to introduce herself, which she
did very prettily. 'How do you do, Mr Clay?
Thank you for giving me such a lovely room'&mdash;everything
was lovely according to Horatia; 'it's the
loveliest I have ever seen&mdash;better than the peacock-room
at Hasingfield.</p>

<p>Now, Hasingfield was the palace of Horatia's ducal
relative, her grandfather, and the peacock-room was
so famous that even Mark Clay had heard of it; so
that Horatia could not have said anything that would
have pleased her host better. He held her hand
for a moment, and looked down at her bright, smiling
face, as he said, 'I'm right glad to see you here, and
welcome you to Yorkshire. And there's nothing here
that you are not welcome to use as your own. Make
yourself at home, lass.'</p>

<p>Horatia's smile broadened as she gave a laugh of
delight. 'Oh, I'm so glad you've called me "lass"!
I was so hoping some one would. That shall be your
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
name for me, and Mrs Clay will call me "my dear,"'
she answered, taking her seat at the table in the best
of humours.</p>

<p>It was a sumptuous repast, and if Horatia got tired
of it and of her host's boastings and unrefined
remarks, she gave no sign, but seemed, as she had
said when she first arrived, to be enjoying herself
immensely.</p>

<p>'So the dreaded introductions were safely and
happily over, and either she is acting or else she
doesn't notice or mind anything,' Sarah said to
herself. But she was wrong, for Horatia was not
acting, and she did notice, and did mind some things.
Later on Sarah was undeceived on this point.</p>

<hr class="para" />
<h3><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></h3>

<h5>HORATIA.</h5>

<p>So the dinner was over, and Sarah heaved a
great sigh of relief as the two followed Mrs
Clay to the drawing-room.</p>

<p>'What are you sighing for, Sarah? One would
think you had just discovered that you were a
pauper, and had eaten your last grand dinner; for it
was a grand dinner. Was it in honour of little, insignificant
me? Because, you know, if it was, perhaps
you wouldn't mind telling Mrs Clay that I don't come
down to dinner at home, but have schoolroom supper
with Nanny; and I don't think mamma would like
me to eat all those things every evening,' observed
Horatia, taking Sarah's arm and doing a rink step
along the hall.</p>

<p>'Oh, we have that kind of dinner every day.
There may have been extra trouble taken because
of you; but father likes it. You needn't eat any
more than you like; but I shouldn't sigh if I
heard it was my last in this house,' replied Sarah
vehemently.</p>

<p>She spoke so vehemently that Horatia stopped her
rinking and looked at her friend in surprise. 'But
it is your home,' she said.</p>

<p>'I'd rather live in a cottage,' declared Sarah.</p>

<p>'You say so; but I'd just like to see you turning up
your aristocratic nose at the tiny rooms; only, of
course, your nose wouldn't turn up properly, not being
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
a snub like mine. Anyway, it would look down on
everything. But, I say, Sarah, what a lovely rink
this hall would make! If it weren't so hot we might
have a fine rink this evening.'</p>

<p>'Oh my dear, not in this 'all; it's real cedar-board,
brought express from abroad for Mr Clay!' cried Mrs
Clay in shocked accents. 'I'm sure I don't know
w'at 'e'd say if you was to suggest such a thing.
Pray don't name it to 'im.'</p>

<p>Horatia laughed gaily. 'I was only in fun. Of
course, I shouldn't rink on a parquet floor. I should
like to see our butler's face if I did it on our polished
oak. I think I'll suggest it to Mr Clay this evening,'
she announced.</p>

<p>'You won't see him again. He never comes into
the drawing-room in the evening, thank goodness!'
said Sarah. The 'thank goodness' slipped out from
habit, and she was rather glad that Horatia did not
notice it.</p>

<p>'We shall just 'ave a quiet evenin'. Mr Clay likes
to smoke 'is pipe after dinner in 'is study, an' I go an'
talk to 'im sometimes. So per'aps you won't mind if
I go an' leave you two to enjoy yourselves alone.&mdash;Your
father seems quite cheerful to-night.&mdash;I think
you an' 'e will get on, my dear,' said Mrs Clay, who
was quite cheerful herself, owing to her husband being
in a pleasant humour.</p>

<p>It was the first peaceful dinner they had had
since Sarah came home; Mark Clay was never a very
pleasant companion, and the dinner-table was very
often the scene of his rages, but Sarah seemed to
anger her father without even opening her mouth,
and her mother, much as she missed her only
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
daughter, was generally relieved when she returned
to school.</p>

<p>But before Mrs Clay thought it was time for her
husband to have finished his wine and retired to
his study to smoke, to the surprise of all three he
appeared in the drawing-room, without the obnoxious
pipe, and with quite a pleasant expression for him.</p>

<p>'I'm thinking this lass will be dull with only us
plain folk, and so I've got a concert for her. Now,
what would you like to hear&mdash;the opera at Covent
Garden, the Queen's Hall concert, or what?'</p>

<p>'Oh, how lovely! The opera, please. That is better
than rinking in your parquet hall, Mr Clay,' cried
Horatia, clapping her hands.</p>

<p>'Rink in my hall!' cried the millionaire, scandalised;
and then, seeing Horatia's twinkling eyes, he laughed
his hoarse laugh, and said, 'You'd have Sykes after
you if you did. What do you want to rink for?
Senseless pastime, I call it. Now, skating I can
understand; it's healthy exercise, and you might
make use of it in cold countries; but rinking&mdash;what's
the use on't?'</p>

<p>'Oh, it's such fun! I do love it so!' cried Horatia.</p>

<p>'Well, now, if it's like that, I'll see what we can do.
I am afraid I can't get a rink built for you in a day,
but I'll see what we can do. For to-night, you'll
have to put up with the opera,' said Mr Clay good-naturedly.</p>

<p>Horatia thanked him profusely, and after he had
left she said to Sarah, 'Oh Sarah, you <i>are</i> rich! I'm
sorry I ever came here to stay with you.'</p>

<p>'Why?' inquired Sarah quickly, as the colour
mounted to her forehead, for she expected that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
Horatia was going to say that she did not like people
who made such a display of wealth.</p>

<p>'Because I sha'n't be contented to be just middlingly
well off after this, and I never wanted to be
rich before; but your father can do everything he
likes,' she cried enthusiastically.</p>

<p>'Oh no, he can't,' retorted Sarah.</p>

<p>'What can't he do?' demanded Horatia.</p>

<p>Sarah paused for a moment. She could not very
well say what was in her mind, which was that he
could not make himself a gentleman, so she said
instead, 'He can't buy people's affection, for one
thing.'</p>

<p>Horatia gave Sarah one of her quick, quizzical
glances, but only replied, 'I don't know so much
about that. There's cupboard-love, at any rate;
but never mind, let's go and listen to this opera. It's
a lovely way of spending the evening,' she added, for
Sarah's face had taken on its disdainful expression
again.</p>

<p>So the two sat down at the gramophone to listen
to Tetrazzini singing in the opera, and Mrs Clay went
off to her husband's study to take advantage of his
being in a good humour to spend the hour with the
husband she worshipped, although she feared him, and
had none too happy a life with him.</p>

<p>Mr Clay was smoking a short clay-pipe. If Sarah
had been there she probably would have said that
another thing that he could not do was to enjoy
refined things, or give himself refined tastes, for one
of Mark Clay's greatest enjoyments was to smoke his
short clay-pipe and the rankest of rank tobacco,
though he only did so in private.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
'She's a nice young lady, Mark, this friend o'
Sarah's, isn't she?' Mrs Clay hazarded.</p>

<p>'Yes, she's a grand lass, is yon. She's always got
a joke ready to crack with you, and doesn't give herself
no airs; and she might, for I find they're a very
high family&mdash;two dukes in it, and other titles as
well,' said Mr Clay.</p>

<p>'Oh, I don't care about 'er titles; she's a dear
young lady in 'erself, an' I'm sure Sarah'll only
learn good from 'er,' said Mrs Clay.</p>

<p>'I wish Sarah'd learn not to give herself airs;
you'd think she was a duke's granddaughter and not
the other. I'm sure she looks at me sometimes as
much as to say, "I'm a princess, and you're only a
common man," and treats me as if I was the dirt
under her feet, instead of being her father, to whom
she owes everything,' said Mr Clay, with an aggrieved
air.</p>

<p>'She's not good-lookin',' said Mrs Clay, who alluded
to Horatia and was trying to put a word in indirectly
for her daughter.</p>

<p>'No, she isn't, there's no denying that; but I'd
sooner have her opposite me at table, for all her plain
looks, than I would our Sally.'</p>

<p>'I wouldn't go so far as that. I'm sure w'en the
two came in to-night, an' our girl lookin' so straight
an' 'andsome, I felt proud o' 'er; but the other is a
dear young lady, an' keeps us all lively,' she said,
repeating her one remark about Horatia that she was
a dear young lady.</p>

<p>'And if you'll believe me, George,' she wrote to her
son two days later, 'your father's a different man
since that little girl has been here, as polite to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
servants since he spoke sharp to Sykes and the little
lady stared at him so surprised like; and so kind to
me I hardly know myself. Not that I'm not very
grateful to him, and know a man like him must have
his worries, and can't always be even-tempered.'</p>

<p>But much had happened during these two days.
Sarah had planned these two days, and, indeed, all
the visit, as a succession of excursions in the motor,
picnics, tennis-parties (for the Clays knew every one
for miles round), and rides, and the next morning,
accordingly, she said to Horatia, 'I thought we might
go to the lakes for lunch to-day; we might start
directly after breakfast, and get back for dinner in
the evening.'</p>

<p>'Oh, haven't you seen the lakes?' asked Horatia in
rather a disappointed tone.</p>

<p>'Yes, of course; but they are always worth going
to see,' replied Sarah. 'But if you don't care to see
them, or would rather go anywhere else, or do anything
else, you have only to say so, and of course
we'll do that.'</p>

<p>Horatia's face brightened. 'Do you really mean
that? May I do what I like just for the first day or
two?' she inquired eagerly.</p>

<p>'Of course you may do what you like to-day and
every day while you are here. I would much rather
you did. I'm tired of doing what I like; and, besides,
it will save me a lot of bother, because I did not want
to go to the lakes at all, and I was going to please you.'</p>

<p>'And I should have gone to please you,' cried
Horatia, 'so we should both have wasted a day; but
I'm afraid you won't care for my plan. I want to
go and see your mills.'</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
'You mean my father's,' said Sarah hastily; but,
though her face fell a little, she continued, 'We shall
have to ask his leave. I'll ask mother to 'phone to
him.'</p>

<p>But this plan of Horatia's was not destined to be
carried out, for a message came back to say that
Mr Clay would rather they came another day, as he
was busy that day, and could not take them over
himself.</p>

<p>'Then just let's go down the town and see the outsides
of the mills. No; not in the motor,' for Sarah
had her hand on the bell to ring for it.</p>

<p>'How, then? Do you want to ride?' inquired
Sarah in surprise.</p>

<p>'No; I want to go on Shank's mare, and poke into
ginnels. I want to go up a ginnel,' she declared.</p>

<p>'But a ginnel is only a narrow passage. The
chauffeur told you so, don't you remember? You've
often been up a passage, I suppose?'</p>

<p>'Yes; but not when it's called a ginnel. I want
to say I've been up one, and I can't bring it in unless
I say, "I went up a ginnel at Ousebank,"' explained
Horatia.</p>

<p>Sarah laughed. 'You are funny, Horatia,' she said.
However, to please her friend she put on her hat, and
the two went off to Ousebank; and whom should they
meet but Uncle Howroyd, who stopped quite naturally
to speak to his niece and her friend.</p>

<p>'And what are you two lasses doing in Ousebank
alone and on foot?' he inquired.</p>

<p>'We've come to go up a ginnel,' said Horatia,
her eyes twinkling.</p>

<p>Mr William Howroyd's twinkled in response. 'Eh,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
what, are you a Yorkshire lassie, then, that you talk
so pat about ginnels? And what particular one do
you want to go up&mdash;the ginnel against my mill?' he
inquired.</p>

<p>'Oh, have you got a mill, and can I come and see
it?' cried Horatia eagerly.</p>

<p>'Why, of course I've got a mill. Didn't Sarah tell
you? Surely you weren't coming to Ousebank without
coming to see me?' he inquired reproachfully.
Then, seeing that Sarah coloured and looked rather
ashamed, he half-guessed the truth, and turned quickly
to another subject, and said, 'Come along, then, both
of you.&mdash;This is not the grandest mill in Ousebank,
Miss Cunningham, nor the largest. My brother
Clay's is much bigger; but it's the oldest, and I like
it best.'</p>

<p>'Oh, please, say Horatia,' she cried, as the three
turned towards Howroyd's Mill.</p>

<p>'Horatia! Any relation to the great Nelson?' he
inquired, looking kindly down on the eager young
face smiling up at him.</p>

<p>'Yes; that's why I am called it; but I like
Macaulay's Horatius best, so I pretend I am named
after him.'</p>

<p>'What!</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then out spake brave Horatius ...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how can man die better<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Than facing fearful odds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the ashes of his fathers<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the temples of his gods?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Isn't that how it goes?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Not quite; you've left out three lines; but that's
the man I mean,' she replied. 'But I forgot. Perhaps
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
I ought not to have asked to go over your mill?
Perhaps you are busy, and don't want us, like Mr
Clay?'</p>

<p>'No, I'm not so busy as he is, and I have always
time for Sarah, as she knows,' he replied; 'though I
don't know that a warm summer morning is the time
to go over a mill and into hot rooms.'</p>

<p>'Oh, please, don't discourage me! I've longed to
see a mill, and now I am really going to.'</p>

<p>Sarah privately thought Horatia rather childish,
but she did not say anything; and Mr Howroyd, who
did whatever he did thoroughly, took them over his
mill.</p>

<p>'Now, I am going to show you the whole process
of making a blanket out of sacks of woollen rags
or wool as it comes off the sheep's back,' he
announced.</p>

<p>'I hope you are not going to make a lesson of it,
Uncle Howroyd,' protested Sarah.</p>

<p>'Of course I am, and am going to question you upon
it afterwards,' he said, his eyes twinkling. 'Only, I
hope you won't be like a young man that came here
for a newspaper once, and went away saying he was
much obliged, and had learnt a lot, and then wrote
in his paper that we made blankets of old newspapers.'</p>

<p>'And don't you?' inquired Horatia innocently.</p>

<p>'No, we do not,' said Mr Howroyd with emphasis;
'and it's about time you did come and see a blanket-mill
if that's all you know about it.'</p>

<p>Horatia not only joined merrily in Sarah's laugh, but
listened quite intelligently to Mr William Howroyd's
explanation of the material used to make blankets.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
'It's most fearfully interesting,' she said with a
sigh.</p>

<p>Mr Howroyd laughed. 'You'd best have gone to
the lakes, as Sarah proposed. This is a very dull
holiday task you've set yourself, Miss Horatia.'</p>

<p>'I never enjoyed any holiday so much in my life,'
she protested stoutly, and a look at her beaming,
interested face confirmed her words.</p>

<h5>A YORKSHIRE MIXTURE.</h5>

<p>'Do you particularly want to walk home,
Horatia?' inquired Sarah as they were
leaving Howroyd's Mill.</p>

<p>'No; I particularly don't want, considering that I
have been driving Shank's mare up awful break-neck
steps and down precipices,' replied Horatia, who had
climbed up and down funny stairs and ladders in the
mill, which she called precipices.</p>

<p>'You are not going home, anyway, just now, for
the mills are just coming out, and the streets will be
crowded, and it's luncheon-time; so you're going to
have a plain lunch with me, if you will honour me
so far,' said Mr Howroyd, and looked for a delighted
acceptance from Sarah. But, to his surprise, Sarah
coloured and looked at Horatia doubtfully. 'I think
they'll be expecting us at home,' she said.</p>

<p>'Oh, will they? Can't we send a special messenger?
I should so like to stay, and I am so hungry.&mdash;You've
no idea how hungry I am,' she said, turning to Mr
Howroyd with a merry laugh. 'Perhaps if you did
you wouldn't ask us to stay.'</p>

<p>Mr Howroyd laughed his cheery laugh. 'It would
be the first time there wasn't enough for any stranger
at Howroyd's. That's not a Yorkshire failing. We've
always enough and to spare for any kind visitor, and
they're always sure of a Yorkshire welcome.'</p>

<p>'What's a Yorkshire welcome like? Is it different
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
from any other kind of welcome?' inquired Horatia
slyly.</p>

<p>'Well, we think it's heartier and more sincere.
You see, we don't go in for show so much as they
do down south; we say there's real old oak up here,
and French-polished deal down there.'</p>

<p>'Oh, what conceit!' cried Horatia. 'Are you hitting
at me?'</p>

<p>'No; at me,' said Sarah a little bitterly.</p>

<p>'I'm hitting at myself; for old oak, you know, gets
worm-eaten.&mdash;And you're quite correct, Miss Horatia;
that was boasting, and in very bad taste. Let's hope
my cook won't have burnt up the chicken and apple-tart
to punish me for it,' he said as he led the way
into the cool, old parlour of the mill, with its wainscoted
walls and old-fashioned furniture.</p>

<p>Horatia sat down in a rocking-chair, and gave a
sigh of satisfaction. 'I feel I deserve a rest. I've
done a good day's work this morning. I'm afraid
I've tired you, Mr Howroyd, and taken up a lot of
your time. I'd no idea it took so long to look
over a mill. Why, we must have been nearly two
hours.'</p>

<p>'Nearer two hours and a half. I calculate one and
a half for most of my visitors; but, then, they don't all
want to know so much as this young lady,' he replied,
laughing.</p>

<p>'Oh, did I ask a lot of questions?' inquired
Horatia.</p>

<p>'You did,' said Sarah.</p>

<p>'Well, I <i>am</i> enjoying myself,' repeated Horatia for
the hundredth time, with always the same emphasis
on the 'am.'</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
Mr Howroyd flashed one of his bright glances at
her. 'That's right!' he said.</p>

<p>'I do like knowing new things and doing new
things, and all this is so new to me. I feel as if I
were abroad, out of England somewhere; and wool-making&mdash;I
mean making blankets and woollen things&mdash;is
most interesting,' said Horatia.</p>

<p>Sarah seemed to be pondering over something.
Suddenly she lifted her head&mdash;'What holiday-essay
are you going to write this summer?'</p>

<p>Horatia gave a merry laugh. 'Oh, well, it wasn't
for that I came to stay with you, Sarah. You mustn't
think that; but, of course, it will be nice and easy to
write one upon wool.'</p>

<p>'Oh, ho! So I have been teaching you your holiday-lesson,
have I?' said Mr Howroyd, as he helped
Horatia to apple-tart and handed her the cheese; for
at Howroyd's Mill no maid waited at lunch. William
Howroyd said he had to be careful what he said
before a servant, and he could reach all he wanted
himself.</p>

<p>Sarah was just putting out her hand to stop her
uncle, but decided not to interfere with him, for
Mr Howroyd never understood a hint, and, with what
his niece considered a lamentable want of tact, would
say, 'What are you driving at, lass?' or 'Speak out,
child; I like plain speaking.' So, much as Sarah
would have liked to prevent her uncle from offering
'such an unfashionable mixture' as apple-tart and
cheese, she abstained.</p>

<p>Horatia stared for a moment; then, thinking it
was absent-mindedness on the part of her host, burst
into a merry laugh. 'You've only just given me
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
apple-tart, Mr Howroyd. I haven't come to the
cheese course yet.'</p>

<p>'But we eat them together in Yorkshire. Come, you
like new things; just try cheese and apple-tart; it's
a very good mixture, to my mind,' said Mr Howroyd
as he held the plate to Horatia.</p>

<p>'Very well, I will try it; but I don't think it
sounds very nice, and if I don't like it you must give
me a lump of sugar; in fact, I think I had better
have one all ready in case it's horrid,' said Horatia,
with pretended resignation.</p>

<p>'I can do better than that,' said Mr Howroyd, as,
getting up from the table, he opened a cupboard and
produced a long, flat box wrapped up in white paper.
'Now, if you don't like our Yorkshire mixture, you
shall have one of these; but if you do like it you
shall have the box.'</p>

<p>'Chocolates!' cried Horatia, opening the box.
Then she took a spoonful of apple-tart, put a square
piece of cheese in the middle of it, and ate it; but
hastily took a chocolate out of the box, put it in her
mouth, and said, 'Delicious!'</p>

<p>Both Sarah and her uncle laughed at Horatia's
way out of the difficulty. 'You didn't like it a bit.
I saw by your face, so you don't deserve that box of
chocolates,' said the former.</p>

<p>'Indeed, she does, and she shall have them if she
will accept them!' protested Mr Howroyd.</p>

<p>So Horatia won her chocolates.</p>

<p>Mr Howroyd had telephoned to Balmoral to say
that the girls were staying to lunch, and a message
was sent back that the motor would be sent about
an hour and a half after the lunch. So, when they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
had finished, William Howroyd led the way into the
drawing-room, a big, old-fashioned room, and, drawing
two chairs up to the large window, brought out all
sorts of quaint, old things for Horatia to see.</p>

<p>'Oh dear! I never saw anything like these things
before; I can't possibly put them into my essay,
because I can't describe them. It is a pity, because
I really think I should get the prize. I'm sure
no one else will see anything so interesting in
her holidays,' cried Horatia, as she examined Mr
Howroyd's family treasures with interest and
reverence.</p>

<p>'I'm sure, I can't see what you find so interesting
in these old things; every one has them,' said Sarah
half-impatiently.</p>

<p>'Nay, lass, every one has not got a tree made of
hair, nor a beautiful model of their church, a hundred
years old, made of cork,' her uncle corrected her.</p>

<p>'They may not have exactly that; but they have
things that belonged to their grandmothers,' declared
Sarah. 'I know you have much grander things at
home, Horatia, though you pretend to admire these
so much,' she protested.</p>

<p>Horatia coloured a little; but it was not easy to
offend her, and she said, with a little laugh, 'I'm not
pretending at all; and I only said what was quite
true, that I had never seen such things before.'</p>

<p>'Then you are simply laughing at us. You are
only interested because we are like savages, with
their trinkets and beads, which they think fine
jewels,' said Sarah.</p>

<p>This time Horatia was really offended, but she did
not say anything; and Mr Howroyd said quickly,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
'I shall begin to think you are ill, Sarah, or sickening
for a fever, and shall telephone to your mother
to send for a doctor, if you talk such nonsense.&mdash;Now,
Miss Horatia, come and see my greatest treasure of
all; and he took her into an adjoining room, without
asking Sarah to accompany them at all. By the time
they had seen his greatest treasure, which was some
wonderful needlework, the motor was announced, and
the two girls got into it.</p>

<p>'Now, I'm just going to time ourselves. We got
home in seven minutes last time; do you think we
could do it in five to-day?' inquired Horatia of
Sarah.</p>

<p>'Certainly not. It's four miles from door to door.
You'd no business to do it in seven minutes; and
if you incite Tom to do it in five he'll get locked
up, if he lives, and he'll well deserve it,' declared Mr
Howroyd.</p>

<p>Tom Fox smiled grimly. He had known Mr Howroyd
and Mr Howroyd had known him since he was
a tiny boy, so he answered, 'You'll not live to see me
locked up, Mr Howroyd&mdash;not for furious driving in
the public road; though I'll not deny that I did put
on speed the day missie speaks of, going through the
park.'</p>

<p>'Oh, well, if you choose to risk your necks in that
wretched car, you must. For my part, there's nothing
like a dogcart with a good trotting horse; that's
fast enough for me; but then I'm fifty years behind
the times, I know. Well, off you go. Good-bye; and
come and see me again, and have some more cheese
to your tart,' he added, with a laugh and a twinkle
of his eye, as he raised his hat to the two girls.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
'I will if you'll give me chocolates to help it down,'
said Horatia; and the car, with a hoot, sped away.</p>

<p>'And we have done it in five minutes,' cried Horatia
as they drew up at the front-door.</p>

<p>Mrs Clay met them in the hall, breathless. 'Mercy
on us, Sarah, w'atever 'appened to the car or Tom?
I'm sure my 'eart was in my mouth w'en I saw you
comin' along the park. I ran all the way down the
stairs, thinkin' I should never see you alive w'en I
got to the bottom,' cried the poor woman.</p>

<p>'It's all my fault. I'm so sorry, Mrs Clay! I
begged Fox to get home in five minutes, and I made
the car go when we got to the park-gates,' said
Horatia penitently, as she linked her arm coaxingly
in little Mrs Clay's.</p>

<p>'My dear, don't you go for to do such a thing
again,' said Mrs Clay, smiling with indulgence at the
girl; 'but it's not you I'm blamin', but Tom Fox,
who ought to know better than endanger two lives,
let alone takin' notice o' a child like you, if you'll
excuse my speakin' so freely.'</p>

<p>'You are very good not to scold me; but I do so
enjoy going at a tremendous speed, and the motor does
run so smoothly, much better than ours, and mother
is too nervous to go fast,' explained Horatia.</p>

<p>'I should think not, an' I don't blame 'er. For my
part, I 'old on every time I go in it if my 'usband
isn't lookin', an' I'd rather by 'alf walk or take the
pony-chaise than go in it; but I'll stop Fox playin'
such tricks. W'atever would your ma 'ave said if
she'd seen you, I can't think.'</p>

<p>They had gone upstairs by this time, and were
walking along the corridor at the back of the house,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
which looked out on the back-yard, which was coach-yard
and garage, and Mrs Clay had scarcely finished
the above speech when they heard the angry voice of
Mr Mark Clay in the yard below.</p>

<p>'How dare you drive my car at that speed, with
my daughter and the Duke of Arnedale's granddaughter
in the car? Don't excuse yourself, but
take yourself off this moment, and never show your
face in Ousebank again, or I'll have you locked up,
do you hear?' stormed Mr Clay at the chauffeur.
But his speech was interspersed with stronger
language than that.</p>

<p>Horatia dropped Mrs Clay's arm, and ran a little
in front of her and Sarah, and both of them thought
she was running to take refuge in her room from
language to which she was not accustomed; but, on
the contrary, she ran to the open window, and, leaning
out of it, cried, 'Mr Clay, stop, please, and listen
to me a moment.&mdash;Don't go, Tom Fox.'</p>

<p>At sight of Horatia, Mr Clay's face changed a little,
and perhaps he felt a little shame at the language he
knew she must have heard; but he was too angry to
heed her. 'Excuse me, but this is my business, and
my orders must be obeyed.&mdash;Get out of this, do you
hear, Tom Fox?'</p>

<p>The man, white as a sheet, touched his hat, with a
faint smile, to Horatia, and walked off.</p>

<p>'Tom Fox, stop!' said Horatia. 'Wait one moment.
If you are really going I will go too, and you can
come to the station with me.'</p>

<p>'Horatia!' cried Sarah; and, 'My dear!' echoed
Mrs Clay.</p>

<p>Mr Clay looked up at the flushed, determined little
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
face at the window. He was a dogged, self-willed
man, and gave way to no one; but he knew when he
had met his match. 'What does this mean, Miss
Cunningham?' he asked grimly, while Tom Fox
stood hesitating in the doorway, and the other
servants stood in the background, wondering what
would be the end of the scene.</p>

<p>'It means that <i>I</i> drove the car at that break-neck
speed, because I turned the high-speed gear, and Tom
could not help himself, and he was too much of a
man to tell tales of me.'</p>

<p>'You can stop, Tom.&mdash;As for you, my lass'&mdash;the
millionaire paused&mdash;'you're a plucky un, you are!
You ought to have Yorkshire blood in you, if you
haven't,' he concluded, and walked into the house
without another word.</p>

<p>'Thank you, miss,' said the chauffeur, as he took off
his hat and stood bareheaded, looking up at Horatia.</p>

<p>'I'm sorry I got you into a row, Tom Fox,' she
said, 'and I promise you I won't interfere with the
motor any more without leave.' Then she withdrew
her head.</p>

<p>'Oh, my dear, I don't believe you'd be afraid
of anything,' said Mrs Clay, looking at her with
admiration.</p>

<p>Horatia only laughed, and Sarah said nothing
either.</p>

<h5>PLAIN SPEAKING CLEARS THE AIR.</h5>

<p>'Your young lady's got a spirit,' said Sykes to
Horatia's nurse, who was as popular below-stairs
as her mistress was above, for it is a
fact that 'Like mistress, like maid,' is a very true
saying, and Miss Cunningham's old nurse behaved in
the same kindly, tactful manner towards her fellow-servants
that her mistress showed towards her.</p>

<p>But on this occasion Nanny, or Mrs Nancy, as the
servants called her, gave way to her feelings, which
had been much ruffled on this visit. 'If by spirit you
mean she don't allow injustice to be done to a poor
man, you're right; but I should like you to know
that this isn't what we've been used to&mdash;not by no
means. Why, our last visit was to Miss Horatia's
grandpa, his Grace the Duke of Arnedale, and there
we didn't have no scenes; I should say not, indeed!
It's not considered good form; that's what they
call it.'</p>

<p>'It's not a bad word, isn't that? You talk of a
prize-fighter being in good form,' observed Sykes.</p>

<p>'Well, our prize-fighter was in good form to-night,
and yet Miss Cunningham knocked him out in the
first round,' interposed a young footman, who went
in for being a wit.</p>

<p>'Don't you get into the habit of making free with
young ladies' names, nor making jokes on them,
young man,' said Mrs Nancy severely, as she took up
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
the work which she had been doing in the shade at
the back of the house, and went indoors.</p>

<p>'Now, there's a funny thing; she's only a servant
same as us, and yet she thinks herself our better
because her family's got blood. Well, ours has got
money, and, for my part, give me good wages and
plenty to eat, and blood be blowed!' remarked the
young footman, who had been nettled at the reproof.</p>

<p>'No low talk here, please,' said Sykes with dignity
as he rose to see about the wine for dinner.</p>

<p>Nanny went upstairs ostensibly to get her young
lady's things out for dinner, although, as it was only
three o'clock, it was rather early; but in reality she
felt that Miss Horatia wanted one of her own people
with her at this moment, so she knocked at her
door, and found Horatia in the silver-fitted bathroom
plunging her head into the marble basin.</p>

<p>'Miss Horatia, my dearie, what are you thinking
about? This hot day it's enough to give you your
death!' she cried.</p>

<p>'Oh Nanny, I was so hot, and my head does ache!
I really couldn't help it,' exclaimed Horatia.</p>

<p>'You lie down on your bed, missie, and I'll lower
the blinds and bathe your head with this spray.
You've overdone yourself getting into such a taking
with that wretched man,' said the old nurse soothingly,
as she patted up the pillows for her charge and
lowered the green sun-blinds.</p>

<p>'He wasn't a wretched man; he had nothing to do
with it. I touched the high-speed gear, I tell you,
and poor Tom Fox was as frightened as any
one.'</p>

<p>'I wasn't speaking of him. I know he wasn't to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
blame. And I'm talking of some one else, as you
very well know, whom there's no living in peace with;
and I know what you're going to say, Miss Horatia&mdash;that
he's our host, and my better, which he may
be the first, but I don't know so much about his
being the second, for my father wouldn't have
demeaned himself by such language to any man, let
alone before women. And as I'm speaking I may
as well say it all out, which is that if the master
and mistress had known what kind of place we were
coming to they'd never have allowed it. And if I
write and tell them'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'Tell them what, pray?' interrupted Horatia.</p>

<p>'What kind of a man Mr Clay is, which no one has
a good word for him; and however you manage to
keep him in good temper, Sykes says, he doesn't
know,' wound up Nancy.</p>

<p>'I don't want to know what Sykes says; and if
you can't talk of more agreeable things than that
I'd rather you went away and left my headache to
cure itself. I'm only tired after looking all the
morning at machines turning round,' announced
Horatia.</p>

<p>'And whatever you can find to please you in that
passes me. Sykes says those woollen-mills are all
one like another, and hot, dirty, greasy places!'
declared Nancy.</p>

<p>'I believe you've fallen in love with Sykes,' said
Horatia wickedly.</p>

<p>'Miss Horatia! Considering he's got a wife and
family!' protested Nancy. But she quoted Sykes
no more, which was just what Horatia wanted and
expected.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
'Now, Nanny, I'm quite all right, so you can get
out my white muslin and blue ribbon,' she said.</p>

<p>'Not that white muslin, miss! You've worn it
three times, and it is so plain compared with Miss
Clay's,' objected the woman.</p>

<p>'So am I, so it's no good my trying to dress like
her, and it's no use your getting angry about it, and
arguing, because you know she's beautiful and I'm
plain. And what's funnier still, I don't envy her a
bit&mdash;oh, I don't mean her wealth, but I mean her
face and figure&mdash;for she isn't a bit happy, and she
doesn't enjoy life, and I do most awfully.'</p>

<p>'Because you try to make other people enjoy it,
and you know the way to win people's hearts. Why,
the way you've won Mr Clay's'&mdash;&mdash; Here Nancy
paused.</p>

<p>'As Sykes says,' added Horatia slyly.</p>

<p>'Well, Miss Horatia, you will have your joke; and
if I was going to say that it's no wonder, seeing that
I have to sit at his right hand, as the place of honour,
at the servants' hall dinner. And, oh, miss, if you
did but see our table! Well, we live well at his
Grace's; but here! You never saw such food&mdash;seven
and eight courses we have, and fruit and wines. I'm
sure I don't know how much they cost.'</p>

<p>'You'll be wanting to stay up here, Nanny; you
will never be contented with our plain food after all
these luxuries,' suggested Horatia.</p>

<p>Nancy gave a scornful sniff. 'I suppose that is a
joke, Miss Horatia; but it's a poor one. For if it
were this house or the Union I'd not hesitate
between them.'</p>

<p>'Is that a joke, or do you expect me to believe
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
you'd rather live in the workhouse than this place?'
inquired Horatia.</p>

<p>'It's no joke. Nothing would induce me to live
here,' said Nancy.</p>

<p>'I wonder why,' said Horatia meditatively. It
was just what Sarah said, she remembered.</p>

<p>'It's not half so wonderful as the way you seem
to have taken to these people,' said Nancy; and
then, feeling that she had gone too far, and that
Horatia thought so, she changed the conversation
and spoke of the dirt of Ousebank, which actually
was blown to Balmoral.</p>

<p>Then the gong rang, and Horatia, cheery and
smiling as ever, went tripping down the grand
staircase to the drawing-room to meet Mrs Clay and
Sarah. This evening, rather to her surprise, Mr Clay
was there, having departed from his usual habit of
going straight to the dining-room and sitting down
at the table before the ladies appeared. He came
forward with a <i>gauche</i> gallantry, and offered his arm
to Horatia. 'Come, little lass, I hear you lunched
at Howroyd's and went over his mill to-day. Couldn't
you have waited one day more?'</p>

<p>'He didn't want us to,' said Horatia, taking the
millionaire's arm with a simple grace, as if it was
quite an ordinary thing for her to go in to dinner
in this style, instead of its being the first time.</p>

<p>'I dare say not. Howroyd was only too proud to
get you there. I'm talking of my mills, which you
could have seen just by waiting a day,' explained
Mr Clay.</p>

<p>'Oh, but I am going to see your mills too. I'll
come to-morrow if you will let us. Of course they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
will be much grander than Mr Howroyd's, so it was
better to see his first and keep the best to the last.'</p>

<p>'Oh ay, our stuff's much grander. We make finer
cloth than Howroyd's, and turn out ten times as
much, I'll warrant,' said Mr Clay, with his boastful
laugh.</p>

<p>'I think, my dear, you'd better leave a day between.
You can't spend all these fine days in factories. You
look tired out, an' Sarah too, trapezing up and down
greasy, slippery stairs,' protested Mrs Clay.</p>

<p>'The wife's right, and I'd as soon you waited a
few days. I don't know that I want visitors in my
mills for a day or so,' chimed in the millionaire.</p>

<p>Sarah looked searchingly at her father, and did
not seem to like what she saw in his face, for she
turned away with a frown. Mrs Clay evidently did
not see anything except that her husband upheld her
opinion, and was kind to her, as he had been ever
since Horatia had come to Balmoral.</p>

<p>'Why don't you want visitors, father?' inquired
Sarah.</p>

<p>'Because I don't,' said her father shortly.</p>

<p>'I dare say you often don't; in fact, I shouldn't
wonder if you would rather visitors never came,
because they must interrupt work dreadfully,' said
Horatia.</p>

<p>'Well, they do interrupt,' agreed the millionaire,
glad to find an excuse, 'and we're just at a busy
time for a special Colonial order; but I'll get you a
day when everything is going smoothly.'</p>

<p>'But Uncle Howroyd is just as busy, and everything
goes smoothly there.&mdash;Doesn't it, Horatia?&mdash;And
he found time to take us round; he said it was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
doing his work all right, because he made a round
of the mill every day, and he might as well take us
with him as go alone, as it made it more agreeable.'</p>

<p>Mr Clay gave a scornful laugh. 'I'd like to see
myself go the round of all my mills daily! Why,
I'd pretty soon be done for. It's easy enough in
a paltry place like Howroyd's; and as for him, he
spoils his people, and spoils other people's too.' And
his face grew dark.</p>

<p>Horatia felt dimly that Sarah was treading on
dangerous ground, and that something was annoying
her host, so she turned to Mrs Clay and said, 'Sarah
says I am to choose what we do every day, so may
I choose to go and fish in the Adder?'</p>

<p>'Why, certainly, my dear; not that you'll find any
fish there; but if it amuses you, go by all means.'</p>

<p>'Don't you worry about an amusement for to-morrow.
I've planned one for you,' said Mr Clay.</p>

<p>'Oh, what is it?' cried Horatia, eager as usual for
novelty.</p>

<p>'If she wants to fish, why shouldn't she?' objected
Sarah, who had no faith in her father's choice of a
day's entertainment.</p>

<p>'But I don't want to fish if there are no fish to
catch. There's nothing duller than sitting all day
and catching nothing,' put in Horatia. 'What's your
plan, Mr Clay?'</p>

<p>'You wait till to-morrow morning, and you'll see,'
he replied as they rose from the table.</p>

<p>'It'll be something horrid, you'll see,' said Sarah
after they had left the dining-room.</p>

<p>'Why should it be something horrid?' inquired
Horatia rather sharply.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
'Because my father has not the least idea what
kind of thing will please you,' retorted Sarah.</p>

<p>'How do you know that?' demanded Horatia.</p>

<p>'Because he is far too ignorant,' said Sarah.</p>

<p>'You are not very respectful to your own father,'
said Horatia rather coldly, 'and I think that's rather
ignorant.'</p>

<p>'Why don't you say we're all ignorant and vulgar?
You know you think it in your heart,' burst out
Sarah.</p>

<p>Horatia looked at Sarah for a minute. 'Would
you like me to say what I really think?' she inquired.</p>

<p>'Yes, I would; I'd rather you said it than pretend
to be enjoying everything and being at home, when
you despise us all in your heart. You showed it this
afternoon, and I know what you think of my father
and mother and uncle, and all of us, although you
are too much of a lady to say so. Oh yes; I can
see your mouth curling with contempt. I know
you are a lady and I am not,' said Sarah, and then
stopped, breathless from her tirade.</p>

<p>Horatia looked at her steadily. 'You are quite
wrong about one thing. I am enjoying myself immensely,'
she began.</p>

<p>But Sarah interrupted her. 'Of course you are,
because you make fun of everything and everybody,
and you will go away home and make fun of us
here as vulgar parvenus.'</p>

<p>'How dare you accuse me of such mean behaviour?
You want to hear the truth, and you shall, Sarah.
There is one person who is vulgar here, and that is
yourself, and you are the only one. I am sorry I ever
came to Balmoral just for that reason, because I used
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
to like you so much at school, and be so proud that
you liked me best&mdash;you seemed so superior to the
other girls; but here you have quite changed and
become despicable.'</p>

<p>'Because you have seen my parents, that is all,'
said Sarah.</p>

<p>'No; it is not for any such reason. I like your
parents very much, and I think your father is a
wonderful man to have made such a position for
himself without any school education; and I love
your mother, and I can't see anything vulgar in them.
Vulgarity, mother says, is pretending to be what you
are not. Education has nothing to do with vulgarity
in its bad sense.'</p>

<p>'I don't believe that. Do you mean to say that
you thought my father's behaviour refined this afternoon?'
inquired Sarah, speaking slowly.</p>

<p>'It was very natural. It would have been vulgar
of my father; but Mr Clay is different. I can't
explain very well; but if mother were here she would
be able to do it. I don't want to discuss your parents;
I'm sorry for you if you can't respect them. And,
please, I'd rather you didn't say so to me. But I
think there's nothing quite so contemptible as being
ashamed of one's family. Why, I believe you are
even ashamed of your uncle Howroyd, and I think
he's the most splendid man I ever saw, and I am
glad we met him this morning, for I verily believe
you didn't mean to introduce me to him, and I should
have been angry if I had missed seeing him and his
mill.'</p>

<p>Sarah did not make any reply, but said, 'Good-night,
Horatia,' and turned to go.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
In a moment Horatia's arms were round her. 'Oh
Sarah! don't be angry and horrid, and don't mind
what I said. Forget it all.'</p>

<p>Sarah turned with wet eyes. 'I dare say you're
right, and I am horrid and contemptible; but you
don't understand,' she said.</p>

<p>'Yes I do, a little; but why should you think so
much about education and titles and things? They
don't really matter, or make you happy; and papa
says they're going quite out of fashion,' said Horatia,
with a merry laugh, as she gave Sarah a final goodnight
hug.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></h3>

<h5>HORATIA SPEAKS OUT.</h5>

<p>One thing Sarah had learnt from Horatia, and
that was to be outwardly respectful to her
father, whatever she might inwardly feel
towards him. It is true, she had been told the same
thing by her mother and brother; but one word from
her schoolfellow had had more effect than all her
brother's arguments or her mother's scoldings.</p>

<p>The next morning dawned cold and rainy; and
Sarah was surprised to find that for once the bad
weather did not depress her, and the prospect of a
day in the house, which she generally dreaded, rather
pleased her than otherwise. The fact was that Sarah
was glad her father's plans for the day were put an
end to. 'He's sure to have thought of something
quite unsuitable, that Horatia would not like,' she
said to herself.</p>

<p>'Isn't this horrid, Sarah?' cried Horatia when the
two met at breakfast, and the rain was falling faster.</p>

<p>'It's a bore; but I dare say we can find something
to do,' said Sarah, after looking out of the window
and seeing no prospect of better weather.</p>

<p>'It 'as turned quite cold; one might think it was
autumn,' complained Mrs Clay, rubbing her hands.
'That's the worst o' our climate, never two days
alike. I'm sure I'm starved in this dress; an' so
must you be, my dear,' she added to Horatia. 'Starved'
is Yorkshire for 'cold.'</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
'I'm dreadfully sorry,' said Horatia, who was
always in extremes of joy or sorrow; 'because of Mr
Clay's lovely plan, which can't come off now.'</p>

<p>'What was it?' demanded Sarah, who imagined
from her way of speaking that Horatia knew and
liked the plan.</p>

<p>'I don't in the least know; but I'm quite sure it
would have been lovely, and now we can't do it,' she
replied.</p>

<p>'I'm not so sure about that,' remarked Mrs Clay.</p>

<p>'Oh, what is it? Do tell me!' cried Horatia.</p>

<p>'I don't think Mr Clay would like me to; but I
think 'e'll be in by the time you've 'ad your breakfast,
an' before it, if you go on as you're doin', my
dear, not eatin' anythin',' she put in; for Horatia, in
her excitement, had put down her knife and fork, and
was letting her breakfast get cold while she questioned
her hostess.</p>

<p>'Hasn't father gone to the mill?' asked Sarah.</p>

<p>'No; 'e's busy over this plan,' replied his wife,
smiling at Horatia, and adding, 'It's not often 'e
breaks 'is 'abit of goin' to the mill by nine o'clock, for
all 'e's so rich, so you must take that as a compliment,
my dear.'</p>

<p>'I do. I think it's most awfully kind of him, and
I'm simply dying to know what his plan is,' cried
Horatia.</p>

<p>'You look anything but dying,' said Sarah, with a
glance at Horatia's bright, eager face.</p>

<p>'If you please, ma'am, the master has sent word
that he'd be glad if the young ladies would come
to the barn as soon as they've finished breakfast,'
announced Sykes.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
Both girls looked in surprise at this request&mdash;which,
however, they both prepared to carry out; and Sarah
remarked that Sykes looked quite excited for him.</p>

<p>'It's the plan! What on earth can it be, Sarah?
What kind of place is the barn?'</p>

<p>'A huge, ugly, dark, long room,' said Sarah in
disgust, for the barn was the last place to amuse one's
self in.</p>

<p>'Oh, then, your father is having a magic-lantern
show for us. Well, it's very kind of him,' said
Horatia in rather disappointed tones, for she was not
fond of a magic-lantern.</p>

<p>'We'd better drive there; it will be wet across
the grass. Put on your 'ats an' take wraps wi' you
in case you get 'ot, for the barn may be draughty,'
said Mrs Clay.</p>

<p>'Are you coming, mother?' said Sarah.</p>

<p>'Yes, my dear, if you don't mind. I sha'n't interfere
wi' your pleasure, an' I'd like to see the magic-lantern,
too,' said Mrs. Clay quite gaily for her.</p>

<p>'Of course, come along. Perhaps Nancy might
come too; she'd like to see it.'</p>

<p>'If she goes, Naomi might as well go too; it's absurd
to have a magic-lantern for three people,' said Sarah.</p>

<p>Mrs Clay said no more, but put on the cloak her
maid brought her, and sat there smiling, in what
Sarah considered rather an aggravating way, till the
large motor which was to take them all to the barn
drove up to the door.</p>

<p>Two minutes brought them to the barn-door.</p>

<p>'Why, there's a band!' cried Horatia; 'or is it a
gramophone?'</p>

<p>The door flew open as if by magic when they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
appeared, and even Sarah gave a cry of admiration
as Horatia, clapping her hands, exclaimed, 'Why, it's
a rink!&mdash;a lovely rink!'</p>

<p>'It is,' said Sarah, and said no more.</p>

<p>'It's better than a magic-lantern, isn't it, my
dear?' inquired Mrs Clay with a happy smile.</p>

<p>'Oh Mr. Clay, you are good!' cried Horatia, as she
laid her little hand in his huge, rough one.</p>

<p>The millionaire held it for a moment as he said,
'That's all right. You're more than welcome, my
little lass. Now, let's see you play this new-fangled
game.'</p>

<p>'But how did you do it? When was it done?
You must have had it done since I spoke two days
ago,' declared Horatia.</p>

<p>'How did I do it? I did it by turning a golden
key, my lass. There's few things that that can't do,'
he replied with a rough laugh.</p>

<p>'I should never have imagined that the barn could
have been made so pretty and artistic. It was very
clever of you to think of it, father,' said Sarah.</p>

<p>The millionaire looked pleased. Perhaps these few
words of his proud daughter gave him more satisfaction
than all Horatia's delighted thanks, for Sarah was
hard to please, and her father always felt that she
secretly, and sometimes openly, despised him; but he
only said, 'You didn't think your rough, old father
knew what dainty young ladies like you and Miss
Horatia would like, did you?'</p>

<p>Sarah coloured, for this was exactly what she had
thought; but she replied, 'Then I was mistaken, for
it is just the thing for this nasty, cold weather.&mdash;Isn't
it, Horatia?'</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
'Yes; but my roller-skates! I have left them at
home. I never thought I should get skating up here,'
said Horatia suddenly, and her face fell.</p>

<p>'You can have mine. I'll send to the house for
them, and we can get a pair in Ousebank for me,'
said Sarah.</p>

<p>'I think we can manage that,' said the millionaire,
as he made a sign to the footman, who brought two
beautiful pairs of roller-skates, and prepared to put
them on.</p>

<p>'It's just like Cinderella or a fairy pantomime,'
cried Horatia, as she started skimming along the
smooth floor.</p>

<p>'My!' cried Naomi to Nancy. 'However can they
keep on their feet with they wheels under their boots?'</p>

<p>'It's habit. Miss Horatia's very fond of the pastime,'
replied the nurse, as she followed her charge
with admiring gaze.</p>

<p>But in a moment Sarah joined Horatia, and then the
relations between Nancy and Naomi became strained,
for if Horatia rinked well, Sarah rinked much better.</p>

<p>'Oh, ain't she beautiful on they things? Why, it's
like a bird, is that,' cried Naomi. 'It's a pastime
where you want a good figger.'</p>

<p>'For my part, I like well-made, strong-built figures
more than such thin ones,' said Nancy.</p>

<p>'If you'd be calling Miss Sarah thin, I'd have you
to know she's not. Her arms are beautiful and
round, and so is she, and it's the grapes that are sour,
Mrs. Nancy,' retorted Naomi.</p>

<p>Mrs. Nancy did not deign even to notice this
remark with a look, but with a slow and dignified
step walked over to where Sykes stood watching the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
two girls with grave, approving face; and Naomi,
who was only a young servant, did not presume to
join these two, and wished she'd kept her tongue still.</p>

</div>

<p>'Ask the band to play "La Rinka," Sarah,' cried
Horatia, 'and we'll go round together and dance it.'</p>

<p>The band, a local one, struck up 'La Rinka,' and
even Mr Clay exclaimed, 'That's something to look
at, Polly, ain't it? There ought to be some folk asked
to see 'em do it.'</p>

<p>At that moment Horatia and Sarah, still with
linked hands, skated up to them, and Sarah said,
'Horatia wishes we could have a skating-party this
afternoon. It sounds rather absurd in August; but
really the weather is more like November, so I dare
say people will like to come.'</p>

<p>'They'll come right enough if I ask 'em to Balmoral,'
said Mr Clay, with his usual laugh. 'There's not
many refuses my invitations.'</p>

<p>Sarah felt her lip curl; but the thought of Horatia
checked her. She gave her a quick look to see if she,
too, was disgusted at this boasting, and felt almost
cross with her schoolfellow when, with a bright smile,
she answered, 'Then do ask them, Mr. Clay. I don't
wonder that your invitations are popular; you do
have such good ideas for entertaining your guests.
When could we have them? To-morrow?'</p>

<p>'You'd better have them to-day. Who knows but
to-morrow may be summer again, and then it'll be
too hot for rinking. We'll just 'phone up a hundred
or so.'</p>

<p>'A hundred?' gasped Horatia, as she thought of the
preparation a party of that kind would require at her
own home.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
'Oh, they won't all be able to come, but half will;
and mother'll give orders for the spread. And now I
must be off. Good-bye, and enjoy yourselves.' And
the millionaire, with a brusque nod, was off.</p>

<p>Mrs Clay soon followed him, and the girls skated
for another hour, and then decided to stop, so as not
to be tired for the afternoon.</p>

<p>'Well, mother, have you got victuals for seventy or
so?' inquired Mark Clay when they all met at lunch.</p>

<p>'Yes, Mark, the <i>chef</i> is seein' to all that, an' 'e is
sure to 'ave everythin' to do you credit.'</p>

<p>'That's right. I've ordered the Ousebank band
up, and I met Bill down town, and asked him up.
He says he can't rink, but he supposes you'll want
some to admire you, so he's coming to do that part.
He's a great admirer of Miss Horatia already, it
appears.'</p>

<p>'I like him most awfully, and everybody else seems
to, too. All the people in his mill do, anyhow; they all
looked glad to see him when he went into their part.'</p>

<p>Mark Clay scowled. 'Ay, it's cheap popularity, is
Bill Howroyd's; but it's bad policy and bad business.
If you let sentiment come into your business you
pretty soon have no business left for it to come into.'</p>

<p>No one made any comment upon these remarks,
and the millionaire went on in his harsh, dictatorial
tones: 'Business is business, say I, and you've got to
keep your people under. I'm not making blankets
and cloth to please them, nor from philanthropy.
I'm doing it to make money, and the man that can
make the most money for me I keep, and the one that
doesn't make enough goes, and the sooner the better.'
And he gave another laugh.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
Mark Clay had been eating between his sentences,
and had his eyes upon his plate, or he would have
noticed Horatia's face. He gave a start of surprise
when she said, with indignation in her voice, 'What
a horrid, hard-hearted way to talk! I think Mr
Howroyd's way is ten thousand times better.'</p>

<p>Poor little Mrs Clay trembled, and even Sarah
grew pale at the thought of the storm Horatia had
brought down upon her devoted head.</p>

<p>Mark Clay stared at this girl who presumed to call
him horrid and hard-hearted, and to hold up as an
example his bugbear and opponent, Bill Howroyd.
Horatia returned his look with a perfectly fearless
one. 'So you prefer Bill Howroyd's way? Perhaps
you prefer his home to mine? He'll never build
himself a Balmoral,' said the millionaire with a sneer.</p>

<p>'No; but he'll have a mansion up in heaven, and
perhaps that's what he's thinking of,' said Horatia.</p>

<p>Sarah looked at Horatia in amazement, and Mrs Clay
looked anxiously at her husband, as if imploring him
not to be hard on this daring child; but Mark Clay
was not taking any notice of any one, not even of
Sykes, who, to divert his attention from this dangerous
conversation, was pressing some delicacy upon his
master, who was staring moodily in front of him.</p>

<p>Horatia had little idea that she had quoted his
mother&mdash;William Howroyd's mother's last words
to her sons, for they had had the same mother, though
their fathers had been very different: 'I've been
very happy here; but I am going to a better mansion
up in heaven. Be sure and join me there, lads,' she
had said.</p>

<p>'Ay, there's something in what you've said, my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
lass,' observed the millionaire after a pause, which
seemed an eternity to those who were present.
'There's sommat in it.' And without another word
he rose from the table.</p>

<p>'Oh Mrs Clay, what have I done? I'd no business
to speak to Mr Clay like that. I don't know what
made me,' said Horatia, rather ashamed of her plain
speaking.</p>

<p>'I think the Almighty made you, my dear; an' may
He bless you for 'avin' done so, an' bless the words
to my dear 'usband,' said his faithful wife. And she,
too, left the room.</p>

<p>'I'd no idea you were religious,' said Sarah to
Horatia when they were alone.</p>

<p>'Do you mean you thought I was a heathen?'
demanded Horatia with a laugh.</p>

<p>'No; but I never heard you talk like that before,'
said Sarah, who could not get over her surprise at the
way Horatia had come out. Truth to tell, Sarah had
an idea that to talk religion was not good form.</p>

<p>'I never heard myself,' laughed Horatia.</p>

<h5>A RINKING-PARTY.</h5>

<p>In spite of Horatia's laugh and her attempt to be
as cheerful as ever, depression seemed to have
fallen on every one, and Sarah looked the
picture of melancholy.</p>

<p>'We'd better go and get ready for our rink-party.
I expect everybody will be thankful to have something
to do this horrid weather. Not that I mean
that they will have accepted your invitation for that
reason,' Horatia added hastily.</p>

<p>'Oh, they come because we're rich, of course,' said
Sarah; and then she suddenly added, as if it were
weighing on her mind, 'I wonder how many would
come if we were to lose all our money. Would you,
Horatia?'</p>

<p>'Thank you for the compliment. No, I don't think
I should; but I should not stay away because you
were poor, but because you are not what I thought
you were&mdash;your character, I mean,' said Horatia, who
could speak her mind at times, as will have been
noticed.</p>

<p>'You would be the exception if you did stick to us.
I expect Uncle Howroyd will, and Naomi, and she
will have to be our general servant,' continued Sarah.</p>

<p>Horatia gazed at her in amazement. 'What in the
world are you talking about? How are you going to
get poor? Oh,' as a thought struck her, 'is there
anything the matter? Do you know, to-day I thought
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
there was. Tell me, is there? Because, if so, I don't
mean what I said. Of course I will come and see
you, and help to cook, too. I can make toffee.'</p>

<p>But instead of answering, Sarah demanded, 'Why
did you think there was something the matter to-day
of all days, when father has just shown you how
much money he can spend merely for a few hours'
amusement? What made you think anything was
wrong?'</p>

<p>'I don't really know, now that I come to think of
it. I don't think I had any reason; it was an idea
that came to me while your father was talking at
lunch,' replied Horatia, hesitating.</p>

<p>'It must have been intuition,' said Sarah solemnly.</p>

<p>Horatia was not only a year younger than her
schoolfellow, but she was far less fond of study, and
she said frankly, 'What's intuition? I know what
tuition is, because my brother has it&mdash;private tuition
from his tutor; but what you mean I can't think,
and I do wish you'd speak out plainly and tell me if
you are in any trouble about money; because, you
know, you need not go spending it on me. I'm quite
content to play battledore and shuttlecock in the hall,
and I didn't want a rink, really.'</p>

<p>Sarah interrupted her with a smile. 'You need
not mind father spending money like that; he's got
more than he knows what to do with at present,' she
said.</p>

<p>'But if he won't have any by-and-by, why don't
you save it up for then?' inquired Horatia.</p>

<p>'He thinks he will always be a millionaire, and so
did I till the other day; and then the idea came into
my head, just as it came into yours&mdash;I can't tell
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
how or why&mdash;that there was something the matter, or
that there was going to be something the matter, and
that one day we should not be so rich. But, Horatia,
please don't ever say such a thing to anybody; it would
do us great harm, even if it were quite untrue, and
perhaps make it come true. And, after all, it may be
only my imagination.'</p>

<p>Horatia looked very grave. 'But, Sarah, if there is
any chance of such a thing, why don't you begin to
save up?' she repeated.</p>

<p>'But, don't you see? if the mill failed we should
have to give up every penny we had, however much
we had saved. But, of course, you don't understand
these things, and the more I think of it the more
impossible it seems. Clay's Mills are as prosperous
as ever. Do let's forget about it. Not that I should
mind for myself, but I should be sorry for mother,
because she likes having lots of money and motors,
though she is afraid to go out in them, so let us hope
she will live and die in this hateful house.'</p>

<p>Horatia did not argue with Sarah as to whether
the house was hateful or not. She rather liked it,
for she was too young to perceive that it was
overladen with costly ornaments, and she revelled in
the royal rooms in which she was installed, and of
which she had written long and graphic descriptions
home. 'Let us hope so, indeed,' was all she said; and
added, 'But do leave off talking about miserable
things and get ready for this party. What ought
I to wear? One ought to have winter things for
skating, but I haven't any best winter dress here.'</p>

<p>'Why not wear your white flannel? And, if you
don't mind, I'll lend you a white feather hat and boa.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
I have never worn them, and I have heaps of other
things to wear; mother has a mania for buying me
clothes, and I have a wardrobeful never touched.'</p>

<p>Horatia was just going to refuse, for she preferred
wearing her own clothes; but she thought it might
please Sarah, so she accepted, and went to her bedroom
with them on. 'I've got a new hat and boa,
Nanny,' she announced.</p>

<p>Mrs Nancy looked at them, and cried, 'How well
they suit you, Miss Horatia! The mistress ought to
get you some like them;' for she guessed at once they
were Sarah's.</p>

<p>'I'm going to wear them this afternoon,' replied
Horatia.</p>

<p>'Wear Miss Clay's hat! Oh Miss Horatia! you can
never do such a thing,' protested the old nurse.</p>

<p>'Why not?' inquired Horatia, as she pirouetted before
the cheval-glass, admiring the pretty feather toque.
'It's the very thing for rinking, and so is this
boa. Look how queerly it is made, with chiffon
twined in; that's what makes it so becoming.
Clothes make a lot of difference, Nanny. I don't
look half so ugly with these on.'</p>

<p>'You never look ugly, Miss Horatia, and you look
"distangy" whatever you put on, so there's no need for
you to put on other folk's clothes to look nice; the
mistress wouldn't like it at all, I'm sure,' said Nancy.</p>

<p>'I don't think she'd mind, Nanny, and I should
vex Sarah if I refused, and that's just what I don't
want to do,' said Horatia.</p>

<p>'Well, they do suit you, and if you've a fancy for
them, and to please Miss Clay, perhaps you'd better;
specially if she's got a temper anything like her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
father's, for they say he's fairly hated at the mills,'
said Nancy.</p>

<p>Nancy did not like Mr Clay, and not all his wealth
could make her think him a fit host for her young
lady; and, indeed, after his explosion in the back-yard
she had taken it upon herself to write to Lady Grace
Cunningham, and said: 'I feel sure, my lady, that if you
knew the people we are with, you would never let us
stay; for not but what this is a palace fit for a king,
and we eat like fighting-cocks. Still, they are not what
I've been used to since I've been in your service, and
his language is shocking, except when in Miss Horatia'a
presence, which she has a wonderful influence over
him, every one says.' In spite of the grammar of this
letter being somewhat involved, Nancy's meaning and
opinions were pretty clear, and Lady Grace Cunningham
took it to her husband, who had a character
rather like Horatia's.</p>

<p>'Let the child stay where she is; it will do her all
the good in the world, as, you see, she is evidently doing
good&mdash;taming this boor, by all accounts. Nancy is a
rank old Tory, and turns up her nose at any one not
born in the purple. Times have changed, as Nancy
will find out one day.'</p>

<p>So Lady Grace Cunningham did not recall them,
but only wrote and told Horatia that she must
shorten her visit if she was not happy.</p>

<p>'I'm enjoying myself immensely. I never met
kinder people,' Horatia wrote back. And so she
stayed on; and as Nancy was living, as she expressed
it, like a fighting-cock, she resigned herself very contentedly
to her lot, as she resigned herself to Horatia's
wearing Sarah's clothes.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
Horatia, with very mingled feelings, went down to
the motor which was to take them to the barn. She
wondered what kind of people would be there. She
had an idea that, as the invitations were issued by
Mr Clay, they would be his friends or people of his
choice, and Horatia looked forward to an afternoon
with a very rough and unrefined set of people.</p>

<p>Sarah wore the daintiest of costumes, just the right
thing for the day and pastime, for Sarah, if left to
herself, had very good taste.</p>

<p>'What a lot of motors, Sarah! Does every one
have one here?' inquired Horatia, as she saw a
number of cars coming up the three avenues which
led to Balmoral.</p>

<p>'Most people do,' said Sarah carelessly; 'and
they'll use them to-day sooner than their horses
because of the bad weather, and some have come a
good distance.'</p>

<p>Tom Fox put on speed so as to arrive at the barn
before the first of the guests, which would not have
been hospitable according to Yorkshire ideas; and the
two girls, accompanied by Mrs Clay, had alighted, and
were standing inside the door ready to receive the
first guests; or, rather, Sarah and her mother were
there, for Horatia had gone away under the pretext
of putting on her roller-skates, and had her back to
the door. The nearer the time came the less she
liked the idea of this rinking-party, for though she
managed to get on with Mr Clay, she felt that seventy
people of that kind would be more than she could
bear.</p>

<p>'Well, Miss Horatia, what will you touch with your
fairy wand next, eh? I shall expect my old mill
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
parlour to be turned into Aladdin's palace after your
next visit,' cried a cheery, brisk voice.</p>

<p>Horatia turned with delight to greet Mr Howroyd.
'I'm so glad you have come!' she said, with more
feeling than she had any idea of.</p>

<p>Mr William Howroyd's keen, kindly eyes gave her
a quick glance, and his sympathetic nature jumped at
the right conclusion. 'Yes, I'm here; and now, as I
can't skate, and you don't know any one here yet,
suppose we go to those raised seats there; we shall
hear the band, and, I can tell you, our Ousebank band
is not to be despised, and we shall see the people
rinking, and if you see any one you particularly want
to know we'll go down and ask Sarah to introduce
her. I don't suppose I shall know half the people
here. I'm not a society man, you know.'</p>

<p>The first to arrive were two tall girls and their
brother, very pleasant-looking and lady-like; and after
them, people came so fast that Horatia could not look
closely at them all; but she noticed that they were all
well dressed and looked ladies and gentlemen. 'But,
then, dress makes a lot of difference,' she repeated to
herself for the second time that afternoon.</p>

<p>'Hallo, Horatia!' cried a boy's voice in her ear;
and, turning, Horatia saw her cousin, once removed,
George Cunningham, grinning at her.</p>

<p>'Oh George, how on earth did you get here?' she
demanded, beaming with delight.</p>

<p>'In the Maddoxes' car, to be sure. Didn't you know
I was staying there?'</p>

<p>'I knew you were staying somewhere in Yorkshire,
but I didn't know it was near here,' she replied.</p>

<p>'As a matter of fact, it isn't so very near; but we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
came over in an hour, in spite of the beastly roads.
But, I say, it's a jolly good idea of yours this,' he
observed.</p>

<p>'Of mine? What do you mean? This isn't my
party; it's Mr Clay's and Mrs and Miss Clay's idea&mdash;this
rink, I mean.'</p>

<p>'Oh, well, he called it Miss Horatia Cunningham's
party. That's what made us come. I wanted to see
you, and see how you get on with these people. But
I'm jolly glad I came. The old buffer does it in style.'</p>

<p>'This is Mr Howroyd, Mr Clay's brother,' said
Horatia hastily, to warn her cousin that he must be
careful what he said; but when she turned to introduce
her cousin to him, Mr William Howroyd had
disappeared. He had slipped away as soon as he saw
that Horatia had a congenial companion. That was
William Howroyd's invariable way, always doing
kindly, unobtrusive acts, and then effacing himself.</p>

<p>George Cunningham gave a hearty laugh. 'The
bird has flown,' he said.</p>

<p>'And a good thing, too. Suppose he had heard
his brother called an "old buffer"?' said Horatia
reprovingly.</p>

<p>'He's heard him called much worse than that, by
all accounts. Your host isn't too popular, for all his
money.'</p>

<p>'Well, anyway, it's horrid of you to come and eat
his food, and then criticise him,' said Horatia.</p>

<p>'Begging your pardon, I haven't eaten anything
yet; and talking of grub, what do you say to coming
and having some? There's a splendid spread behind
that glass screen,' he said.</p>

<p>'It's much too early.  Don't be so greedy, but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
come and rink before it gets too full,' said Horatia;
and the two went off.</p>

<p>When they had made several rounds, Horatia
stopped near the two tall girls who had come in first,
and they immediately complimented her on her
rinking. 'You rink as if you thought no one was
looking at you,' they told her.</p>

<p>Horatia laughed. 'How should one rink when
people <i>are</i> looking? In a different way?' she asked.</p>

<p>'No, one shouldn't; only most people look a little
self-conscious,' they replied.</p>

<p>Horatia noticed the slight Yorkshire intonation
which she thought so musical, and was inclined to
laugh at her former fears, for there were no 'Mark
Clays' at the party, and she soon heard many familiar
names mentioned as being present.</p>

<p>One of the Maddox party eventually asked her to
have an ice. 'Come and sit in this alcove place, and
I'll fetch you one,' he suggested.</p>

<p>Horatia was tired, for she had already rinked for
some time in the morning, and she sat back in the
alcove, half-hidden from sight.</p>

<p>'I always wonder how many more entertainments
Mark Clay will hold out for?' said a voice quite near
her.</p>

<p>'Why, is he shaky?' inquired another.</p>

<p>'Not that I know of; but these fortunes made in a
day, so to speak, generally melt away in the same
way.'</p>

<p>'I understood he was a solid man,' said the second
speaker.</p>

<p>'So he is&mdash;so he is, for aught I know. I only know
that we all have that feeling about him.  Perhaps
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
the wish is father to the thought, for he's none too
popular.'</p>

<p>'Still, you need not wish him to be ruined, even if
you don't like him. I suppose he does some good
with his money? These rich Yorkshire manufacturers
are most generous as a rule,' said the other, evidently
a stranger.</p>

<p>'He's an exception. His half-brother, Howroyd,
gives twice as much, with not a quarter his money.
Pity he's not the millionaire, now. He's beloved far
and near.'</p>

<p>'What's wrong with Clay? This is a generous
entertainment, for instance.'</p>

<p>'Oh yes, he'll do this to show off; but he's an
awful brute to his workpeople&mdash;grinds them down
and shows no mercy to weak or worn-out employ&eacute;s.'</p>

<p>'Here, Horatia, I've got the ice,' said young
Maddox.</p>

<p>'Thank you. I'm glad we're not millionaires,
Jack. People only hate you for it,' she remarked.</p>

<p>'Do they? I'd chance that if I could be one.
Look what this man can do? Anything he likes!
Make a rink in a day! Come on and have a turn,'
said young Maddox, to whom this particular example
of the power of wealth naturally appealed.</p>

<p>Horatia was unusually quiet, for her, that afternoon,
and the moment Mr Clay appeared at the door she
started up to him to tell him how much they were
enjoying themselves, for she wished to show him
attention, and to show him, too, that she had not
meant to criticise him that afternoon.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></h3>

<h5>HORATIA'S INFLUENCE.</h5>

<p>The millionaire did not look very prepossessing
as he stood near the door, his tall, powerful
form towering above the young skaters; his
coarse, red face darkened by a scowl.</p>

<p>'There's an ugly-looking brute just come into the
rink,' young George Cunningham had said to Horatia,
who had replied, 'That's Mr Mark Clay,' and had
made straight for her host, dodging the skaters very
cleverly.</p>

<p>Sarah, on the other hand, who had been near the
door when her father appeared, gave one glance at
his ill-tempered face, and skated in the opposite
direction. She thought that he had not seen her. Not
that it would have made any difference, for his family
were wont to avoid their head when he was what his
wife called 'put out about something'&mdash;which, alas!
was only too frequently the case.</p>

<p>Not so Horatia. She saw the danger-signals, but
was no more afraid of him than she would have been
of a fly, to use her own expression. 'We are enjoying
ourselves so much! It was a brilliant idea of yours,'
she said, beaming at him and giving his arm an
approving pat.</p>

<p>Mark Clay looked down at the eager little, freckled
face, with its snub-nose; and, in spite of himself, he
smiled back at her. 'I'm glad you are enjoying
yourself. I did it for that.  You must come and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
spend your winter holiday with us. It'll be a more
seasonable pastime then, it seems to me,' he replied.</p>

<p>'But are you going to keep this as a rink? I
thought you used it as a barn in the autumn and
winter?' inquired Horatia.</p>

<p>'We can build another,' he replied lightly, as if
building another huge barn was the work of a few
hours. 'Come, let's see you go round.'</p>

<p>Horatia accordingly started off, and Mark Clay
followed her with approving eyes.</p>

<p>'She's a nice, dear girl, isn't she, Mark?' said his
wife, emboldened by her husband's softer expression
to approach him.</p>

<p>'She is that,' he replied with emphasis.</p>

<p>'The man seems fond of his daughter. I heard he
was as harsh at home as he is abroad; but I see he
has been maligned,' said a visitor, who did not know
Sarah.</p>

<p>'That is not his daughter, I am sure, for they say
she is the prettiest girl in Ousebank,' replied a friend.</p>

<p>'Well, that is a very nice, bright-looking girl, and
a millionaire's daughter is always pretty in the eyes
of the world; gold makes most things beautiful,'
replied the lady; and she had hardly uttered the
words when Sarah herself, noticing that the two were
strangers, and had not had refreshments, came up to
them.</p>

<p>'Won't you come and have some tea?' she asked in
her dignified and rather stiff way.</p>

<p>'Thank you; it would be nice. Are you Miss Clay,
then?' inquired the lady, who recognised that she
was speaking to the prettiest girl present, at all
events.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
'Yes,' said Sarah gravely.</p>

<p>'We thought the young lady laughing and talking
to Mr Clay must be his daughter; they seemed so
friendly,' observed the stranger, as she and her friend
skirted the barn to get to the refreshment-tables.</p>

<p>Sarah could not help colouring slightly. 'No; she
is only a schoolfellow who is staying with us,' she
replied; and the lady thought she had never met
with such an unapproachable girl, and wondered
whether it was shyness or pride. She had no idea
that she was touching on a sore point.</p>

<p>When the party was over and the last motor had
disappeared down the long avenue, Horatia gave a
little sigh of relief. 'I am glad they have gone. I
couldn't have skated another minute,' she said.</p>

<p>'You needn't have gone as long as you did. Why
didn't you stop?' demanded Sarah with uplifted
brows. 'I was wondering at you; you scarcely rested
at all. I'm not a bit tired, because I rested at
intervals.'</p>

<p>'I simply can't stop when I see other people. I
must rink too,' she declared.</p>

<p>There was a glorious sunset, and Tom Fox prophesied
a fine day on the morrow.</p>

<p>'So it will be too hot to rink then, and it's just as
well, as you have such a mania for it that you wear
yourself out,' observed Sarah.</p>

<p>'Yes, my dear, you 'ave such dark circles round
your eyes! I don't know w'at her ladyship would
say if she could see you just now lookin' so tired,'
added Mrs Clay.</p>

<p>'She would say I was a foolish girl, as she did last
time I came from the rink dead-tired. I expect it's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
like taking to drink,' said Horatia, and she gave a
merry laugh.</p>

<p>Mr Clay smiled at her. He was very quiet; but
he had lost the scowl he had when he arrived at the
barn, for which his wife was very thankful.</p>

<p>'To-morrow I am going over your mills, you know,
Mr Clay,' she informed him.</p>

<p>He opened his mouth as if to protest, but only said,
'You'll be too tired; better rest a few days. You
shall go over the mills before you go home. Not that
there is anything so very wonderful to see, or to
interest a young lady like you.'</p>

<p>'I haven't half-written my essay yet; I expect I
shall find some more to put in after I've been round
with you,' explained Horatia.</p>

<p>'Don't you go putting me and my mills into print,'
said the millionaire, looking almost afraid.</p>

<p>Horatia only laughed merrily as ever. 'I'll let
you read my essay before I send it up. Yes'&mdash;clapping
her hands&mdash;'that's an awfully good idea. You shall
read it through, and tell me anything I have left out;
and you shall sign at the end, "Audited and found
correct.&mdash;Mark Clay, millionaire mill-owner."'</p>

<p>It was impossible not to laugh at the girl, and
equally impossible to be gloomy while Horatia was
bubbling over with good spirits. The drooping line
round Mrs Clay's mouth had almost disappeared since
Horatia's advent.</p>

<p>During this drive even, Horatia had managed to
chase away Mr Clay's ill-humour, and his wife leant
back comfortably, with a feeling that she need not
fear any storms, as the dear young lady would 'keep
things pleasant.'</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
When they got out of the motor and were going
together to their rooms, Horatia took Sarah's arm and
began dancing along the polished surface with a
rinking movement. 'I thought you said you were
tired out, and I thought, too, that the rink was
specially built to prevent you from rinking here,'
observed the latter, who was trying, with some
difficulty, to keep her balance and her dignity during
this peculiar mode of progress.</p>

<p>'So I did. I must stop,' agreed Horatia.</p>

<p>'You said I had changed, and that you did not
know me before you came here. And I certainly did
not know you,' remarked Sarah abruptly.</p>

<p>'How am I changed? I feel just the same,' said
Horatia, stopping short and facing Sarah. 'Didn't
I always laugh and make jokes at school? Where's
the difference?'</p>

<p>Sarah did not reply directly, for it was difficult to
explain what she meant. 'I did not say you were
changed. I said I did not know you, and I don't
now. Why are you so nice to my father?' she
suddenly demanded.</p>

<p>'I've a good mind to ask you why you are so nasty
to him,' retorted Horatia; 'but I won't, because I
don't want to know. And as for my being nice to
him; you don't generally go and stay in people's
houses, and then be rude or disagreeable to them.
Besides'&mdash;&mdash;and here Horatia stopped.</p>

<p>'Besides what?' asked Sarah.</p>

<p>'Besides, it's time to go and dress for dinner. I
shall feel quite dull and unimportant when I go home
and have to be a schoolgirl again; no dressing for
dinner, and no dinner to dress for, only schoolroom
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
supper, and it all depends upon cook's temper whether
we get anything very nice or not,' laughed Horatia.</p>

<p>As Horatia evidently did not intend to answer her
question, Sarah said no more on the subject; but she
wondered very much what Horatia meant to say.
Sarah knew quite well she had not meant to say,
'Besides, it is dinner-time.' Perhaps it was as well
Horatia had stopped before she added that she was
'sorry for Mr Clay.' 'Because,' she observed to herself,
'she would have wanted to know why I was sorry
for such a rich man, and I really could not have told
her. And, besides, Sarah is so proud that she would
hate to be pitied.'</p>

<p>Sarah walked thoughtfully to her room, and there,
instead of dressing for dinner, she threw herself
down in her favourite place, the broad window-seat
that looked towards Ousebank, her chin resting on
the two palms of her hands. 'Why am I so nasty to
him?' she muttered to herself. 'Why is every one
nasty to him? At least, I don't know that we are
any of us nasty&mdash;he wouldn't let us; but we are not
"nice," like Horatia.' Sarah did not attempt to
answer this question; she sat there staring out over
Ousebank, and asked herself why she could not be
'nice' to her father if Horatia could.</p>

<p>Naomi came to the door twice and knocked, and
the second time she ventured to open it; but, seeing
Sarah, as she thought, looking cross and staring out
of the window, she went away again without daring
to interrupt her. But as time went on and no call
came from her young mistress, the good girl began to
be anxious for fear Miss Sarah should be late for
dinner and thereby 'upset' Mr Clay, a thing to be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
avoided. So she came in, and, standing at the door,
coughed. She had to do this two or three times
before Sarah woke up to the fact of her presence,
which she did with a start. 'Oh Naomi, what is it?'
she asked.</p>

<p>'Dinner, Miss Sarah,' said Naomi.</p>

<p>'Dinner?' Sarah started up in real fright this time.
'Has the gong gone? I never heard it,' she cried.</p>

<p>'No, miss, not yet, but it soon will,' said Naomi,
bustling about to get Sarah ready.</p>

<p>'Then what do you mean by telling me such a
story? I've a good mind not to get ready at all,'
said Sarah irritably and rather foolishly.</p>

<p>'Whatever would be the good of that, Miss Sarah,
upsetting of Mr Clay for nothing, let alone that I
never told no story? You asked me what I came for&mdash;at
least, so I understood it&mdash;and I answered you,
"Dinner," and that's what I am here for. Oh, do make
haste, Miss Sarah! You could keep on that white
skirt, and just slip on this pretty bodice; master won't
never notice. There's the gong! Oh dear, oh dear!'
said Naomi, getting quite flustered in her anxiety to
get Sarah ready in time.</p>

<p>'You needn't be in such a state, Naomi; we are
not all slaves or prisoners that we have to be ready
to a minute,' observed Sarah coolly, and taking extra
long instead of hurrying.</p>

<p>'No, Miss Sarah; but there's no call to do things
a purpose to annoy any one. Now, there's Miss
Horatia going down as pleasant as can be,' protested
Naomi.</p>

<p>'You see we can't all be as pleasant as Miss Horatia,
Naomi,' remarked Sarah a little bitterly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
'You can be a deal pleasanter than her. Why, a
word or a smile from you goes further than all Miss
Horatia's smiles, if only you'd give yourself the
trouble. Not that I'm saying a word against Miss
Cunningham, for there's no denying she makes the
house a different place; and so they all say, from the
master downwards,' observed Naomi, her loyalty to
her young mistress struggling with her desire to be
just and truthful.</p>

<p>'How does she do it, Naomi? I can't make it out.
The house has been much more comfortable since she
came, and yet she doesn't do anything but laugh, and
you know any fool can laugh,' said Sarah, as she
laughed herself and ran off after Horatia.</p>

<p>'Miss Horatia's no fool, though,' observed Naomi, as
she folded up and arranged Sarah's clothes.</p>

<p>Before dinner was half-over, Sarah had to acknowledge
to herself that she had not been fair to Horatia
in saying that she made things pleasant by laughing,
and it fell out in this wise.</p>

<p>The two girls arrived in the drawing-room at the
same moment, and there, according to his new practice,
they found Mr Clay, who had taken to coming
properly into the drawing-room and going into
dinner with his women-folk. His face lightened
as he saw the two girls; but instead of offering his
arm to Horatia, he gave it to his wife.</p>

<p>Mrs Clay did not take it for a moment. Such an
attention had never been paid her before in all their
married life, for long before Mark Clay had gained
his wealth he had ceased to show any civility to his
wife.</p>

<p>Sarah was as much surprised as her mother, though
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
she had more tact than to show it. Horatia looked
pleased, but said nothing.</p>

<p>In the middle of dinner one of the footmen, who
had gone out to get a dish, came in with perturbed
countenance, and said something to Sykes in an
undertone.</p>

<p>'Impossible,' said the butler. 'Say we're at dinner,
and they must wait.'</p>

<p>'They say they won't wait,' murmured the footman,
and added something more, which apparently startled
Sykes, who, giving some orders to the under-footmen,
left the room, and after a short absence came back
and said to Mr Clay, 'Excuse me, Mr Clay, but you're
wanted just a minute.'</p>

<p>'Wanted?' exclaimed the millionaire, with a dark
flush on his face. 'Tell them to be off, whoever
it is.'</p>

<p>'Please, Mr Clay, sir, excuse me, but if you'd see
them a minute. It's a deputation from the mill,'
insisted Sykes.</p>

<p>Mr Mark Clay turned with a face distorted by
rage; but before he could say a word Horatia cried,
'Oh Mr Clay, do let me come with you and listen to
the deputation. I do so want to hear real Yorkshiremen
talk.'</p>

<p>'You can hear me. I talk broad enow at times,'
said the millionaire, purposely speaking broad Yorkshire;
'and I've nowt to say to them.'</p>

<p>'You'd just better go,' she said, nodding her head
at her host. 'Father says things are topsy-turvy
now, and the poor man has more power than he
used to have; and, besides, I would like to hear
them talk.'</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
'Come forward, then,' said the millionaire, and rose
from the table.</p>

<p>Sykes cast a look of gratitude and relief at Horatia;
and poor Mrs Clay, wiping away a tear, said, 'God
bless her!'</p>

<h5>A MILLIONAIRE FOR FIVE MINUTES.</h5>

<p>'Oh Sarah, I do 'ope they will come to an
agreement! There's a lot o' discontent
goin' on, an' your father is that determined,'
sighed little Mrs Clay.</p>

<p>'Do you think he really is my father?' demanded
Sarah.</p>

<p>'W'atever do you mean by talkin' such nonsense?'
inquired Mrs Clay, indignation taking the place of
anger for the time.</p>

<p>'Only that one would think he was Horatia's father,
to see the way she goes on, as if she were a daughter
of the house,' replied Sarah, her lip curling.</p>

<p>'Sarah, I'm ashamed o' you showin' such wicked
jealousy to that dear girl. If you got on wi' your
father there'd be no occasion for 'er to do as she does;
but if she 'adn't interfered to-night w'at would 'ave
'appened? A strike very likely, an' we're not safe
from it yet. There's a lot o' discontent,' repeated
her mother.</p>

<p>'I hate interfering people!' was all Sarah said.</p>

<p>Then there was silence, while both mother and
daughter strained their ears to listen for any sound
of voices from without, dreading to hear Mark Clay's
loud, rough voice raised in angry tones. But no
sound was to be heard, and Mrs Clay said after a
time, 'I'm glad 'e's listenin' to 'em; it'll do 'em
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
good if they can say their say, even if 'e don't give
way to 'em.'</p>

<p>Horatia meanwhile had tripped away with a light,
dancing step, for which she was very often taken to
task, not only at school, where she was told to walk
properly and be more serious, but also by her mother,
who said it was undignified for a girl of fifteen.</p>

<p>Mark Clay walked heavily beside his young companion,
scarcely listening to her chatter&mdash;for it must
be confessed that Horatia was rather a chatterbox, or,
as her father said, 'had a good deal to say for herself'&mdash;but
some words she said caught his ear. 'I dare
say they are envious of your riches. I never cared to
be rich before; in fact, I never thought about money,
because we always seem to have everything we want
at home; but since I have been at Balmoral I have
envied you your riches, and thought it was rather
unfair that you should have such a lot.'</p>

<p>'Oh, you think I've more than my share, do you,
like all the rest of them? Well, I s'pose it's natural;
but I'm not going to share it up for all that, as
they'll pretty soon find out,' replied the millionaire.</p>

<p>Horatia had the sense not to say any more, and,
indeed, there was no time, for they were at the door
of the steward's room, where business was transacted
in connection with the employ&eacute;s on the estate, and
in this room were six men standing, cap in hand, near
the outer door, which led into the yard.</p>

<p>Horatia wondered to herself if they kept near that
door so as to have a way of escape in case their
master got into one of his passions; but these sturdy
Yorkshiremen were afraid of no one and nothing.
Strong, sturdy, and independent, they stood there,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
with civil but determined faces. They were the old
mill-hands, and had been with Mark Clay from boyhood;
and among them was Naomi's father.</p>

<p>'Well, men, is t' mill burnt down that I can't even
eat my dinner in peace, but must come at once to
speak with you?' inquired Mr Clay.</p>

<p>'Sorry to interrupt your dinner, master; but we
know it's a long business, is that, up at Balmoral, and
we've got to take an answer back to our mates down
Ousebank by nine o'clock,' said Naomi's father, who
was evidently the spokesman.</p>

<p>'Oh, and what may you want to know?' inquired
Mark Clay in a tone which did not promise much.</p>

<p>Luke Mickleroyd looked for a moment doubtfully
at Horatia. 'It's business we want to talk, Mr Clay,'
he said.</p>

<p>'Have your say, lad, and have done with it. This
young lady is going to judge between us to-night,
and the sooner you say what you've got to say the
better we'll be pleased, for our dinner's cooling on
the table, and that's not the way we treat guests up
north,' said Mr Clay in a more conciliatory tone.
The reminder of Horatia had done Luke Mickleroyd's
cause a good turn, as he saw.</p>

<p>'Well, master, it's like this, only I doubt little
missy there won't understand aught about it. The
young men say there's a lot more boys taken
on in the mill to what there ought to be,' began
Luke.</p>

<p>Mr Clay interrupted angrily. 'Ought to be? And
who's to settle that but me?'</p>

<p>'I am, for to-night; you said I might. Do let me
feel like a millionaire just for five minutes!' said
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
Horatia in an undertone, pulling at the mill-owner's
sleeve to make him attend to her.</p>

<p>The millionaire threw himself into the big armchair
at the top of the broad table which divided him
from his men, and said with a rough laugh, 'Have
your way, lass. I'm rich enough to let you have
your whim, if you don't go too far. Let's see how
you'd manage a mill.&mdash;Now then, Luke, let Miss
Cunningham hear your tale, and see what she says
to it.'</p>

<p>'We've got to deal with you, master,' began one of
the others rather gruffly, for he thought Mark Clay
was treating them and their wrongs lightly.</p>

<p>But Luke Mickleroyd had heard from his daughter
Naomi of the influence Horatia had over the mill-owner,
and said, 'I'm spokesman, if you please, mates.&mdash;And
this is what we've come to say. There's two
men been turned off because they've been ill, and
boys put on in their place.'</p>

<p>'They did no more work than the boys,' observed
Mark Clay, 'and took double the wages.'</p>

<p>'They didn't do quite as much work, 'tis true; but
they did it better, and we always made up by the end
of the day between us what they couldn't manage
when 'twas heavy work; but the men say they ain't
going to do it for the boys.'</p>

<p>'No, of course not,' said Horatia impulsively.</p>

<p>'Oh, of course not, you say?&mdash;Well, go on,' said Mr
Clay.</p>

<p>'And these men have got wives and families to
support, and who'll take them on if they're turned
out of Clay's Mills for not being able to do their
work?'</p>

'I've nought to do with that. Business is business,
and you can't mix sentiment up with it,' said the
master.</p>

<p>'But, then, some one will have to support them,'
said Horatia.</p>

<p>'The rates will,' said Mr Clay.</p>

<p>'Well, you pay the rates, so you may just as well
keep them at the mills; the work gets done, and it
makes no difference to you whether their friends
help them to do it or not, and, you see, it won't get
done with those boys, because the men won't help
them. So, I say, take the two men back.&mdash;And, oh! I
do think it kind of you men to do their work, and
come and speak up for them,' wound up Horatia.</p>

<p>Mr Clay gave her a glance. The plain little face
was lit up by animation, and he smiled. Then he
turned to the men. 'Very good, lads; you hear what
the young lady says. I promised her her way, and
she shall have it.' Here his face grew stern. 'But
it's to her I've given way, not to my men, remember
that. What Mark Clay does is done, and won't be
undone; and there's no parleying between master
and man in Clay's Mills; so the next time the men
want to come up to see me, tell them it's no good;
Mark Clay receives no deputations from his men.
If they don't like his ways they can leave him; it's
as they like.'</p>

<p>'We're not likely to do that without we're forced.
We've worked for you, man and boy, these thirty
years, some of us, Mr Clay,' said Luke Mickleroyd.</p>

<p>'I sha'n't force you. I know good workers when
I've got 'em, and give 'em good wages, too,' said Mr
Clay. And this was quite true, and no better work
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
was turned out of any mill than that done by Clay's
Mills.</p>

<p>'We thank you for receiving us to-night, master.&mdash;And
we are much obliged to you, miss, for your kind
words,' said Luke Mickleroyd.</p>

<p>The millionaire rose from his seat. 'And now, I
suppose, we can go and have our dinner?' he said
sarcastically.</p>

<p>'Good-night, Mr Clay.&mdash;Good-night, miss,' said the
men, and they filed out into the yard.</p>

<p>The millionaire grunted something which might be
interpreted to be a farewell, and turned to walk out of
the other door. He did not wait to let Horatia pass
out first; indeed, he had never even offered her a seat,
though he had sat down himself, these courtesies not
being in his way. Horatia, however, did not seem to
notice the want of politeness, but said a bright goodnight
to the deputation, and followed her host out
of the room.</p>

<p>Sykes was waiting at the back-door, watching the
door of the steward's room; and beside him was
Naomi, and the moment the men appeared she ran
forward and said, 'Has he given in, father?'</p>

<p>Sykes followed, and came up in time to hear Luke
Mickleroyd reply, 'Yes, he's given way this time, lass.'</p>

<p>'That's a good job! Well, go on into the servants'
hall, and have a drink to celebrate the good news. I
must make haste and serve the rest of the dinner.
And another time do you take and come a little
later and give a man a chance to have his dinner in
peace,' said Sykes, hurrying off.</p>

<p>'I think we'll be going on to give the answer. I
don't feel in no mood for drink,' said Luke.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
'Why not, lad? All's well that ends well, and
we've got our way this time,' said one of the others.</p>

<p>'Ay, we've got it this time; but we sha'n't get it
next, without that young lady works miracles, same
as she seems to do wi' Mark Clay,' replied the man
gloomily.</p>

<p>'Tell us about it, father. She's really jolly, ain't
she? Whatever did she go to see you for? She's a
caution, is Miss Horatia!' exclaimed Naomi.</p>

<p>'She's a real good young lady, and wanted to do
the family and us men a good turn. Now, if he'd
got a daughter like that!' said Luke.</p>

<p>'Oh, come, father, I'm not going to have a word
said against Miss Sarah. She's not gay like Miss
Cunningham, 'tis true; but she's as grieved ['grieved'
means 'vexed' in Yorkshire] about the way her father
carries on as can be, only she's too much of a lady
to go putting herself in a man's place,' said Naomi,
defending her young mistress hotly.</p>

<p>'The other's more of a lady if you go by blood,'
put in Tom Fox, who was a staunch admirer of
Horatia since the affair of the motor, and had heard
from Cunningham's chauffeur who Horatia was.</p>

<p>'We don't go by blood here; we go by money,' said
Naomi scornfully; and the other servants laughed.</p>

<p>Mrs Nancy, needless to say, was not there, or this
conversation could not have taken place.</p>

<p>Mrs Clay looked up eagerly when the two returned.
Sarah, too, looked up, and, though she did not show it,
she was just as anxious to hear the result. But neither
of them dared to put any questions to Mr Clay.</p>

<p>'Here's a young lady who wanted to be a millionaire
for five minutes,' he said, with a hoarse laugh.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
'W'atever do you mean, Mark?' asked Mrs Clay
timidly.</p>

<p>'It's all right, Mrs Clay. Mr Clay agreed to do
what they wanted,' said Horatia hastily, to relieve her
anxiety.</p>

<p>'Nay, lass, that I didn't. I agreed to do what you
wanted, and that's a very different thing, as the
men'll find out if they try it on again. There's only
one will in Clay's Mills, and one person to have any
wants,' said the mill-owner.</p>

<p>'What does he mean about your being a millionaire
for five minutes?' demanded Sarah, who did not
want her father to begin a tirade about Clay's Mills
and his rights.</p>

<p>'I just wanted to be a millionaire for five minutes,
and Mr Clay let me.&mdash;You <i>are</i> good-natured to
me!' Horatia said, turning to her host and beaming
at him.</p>

<p>'And you used that five minutes' power to give the
men their way? They'll always want it now,' said
Sarah slowly.</p>

<p>'That's what I'm a bit afraid of; but I'll teach
them a lesson next time,' said Mr Clay grimly.</p>

<p>'Oh Mark! don't be 'ard on 'em,' began Mrs Clay.</p>

<p>But Horatia exclaimed, 'He wasn't a bit; he was
very nice, and has taken two delicate men with
families back into the mills.&mdash;I must see these mills,
Mr Clay,' said Horatia.</p>

<p>'So you shall to-morrow, if you like, and then
you'll see them two fettlers doing their work, as if
they'd all day to fettle one machine,' replied Mr
Clay.</p>

<p>'What's a fettler, and what is to fettle a machine?'
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
inquired Horatia with interest. 'I think I've heard
that word before.'</p>

<p>'Clean it up, and if they don't do it sharp while
the machine is going there's an accident, and they
get caught in the works, and that's what'll likely
happen to them two, and you'll feel sorry then you
had them back,' he replied.</p>

<p>It was late when they had finished dinner, and the
mill-owner said 'Good-night' when his wife and the
girls left the dining-room.</p>

<p>'Oh my dear, God bless you!' cried Mrs Clay when
they were in the drawing-room, as she took Horatia's
hand in hers.</p>

<p>'I didn't do anything; I just amused myself,' said
Horatia, laughing. 'But I expected to see quite
different men. They looked quite quiet and respectable.'</p>

<p>'What did you expect them to look like?' demanded
Sarah. 'They were respectable mill-hands, as my
father was years ago.'</p>

<p>'But I expected to see wild, fierce men, like those
in the French Revolution, demanding their rights,
and brandishing sticks and things.'</p>

<p>'Oh my dear! we ain't come to that, an', please
God, we never shall,' protested Mrs Clay with a
shudder.</p>

<p>'They can look wild and fierce. You've only to
watch them at a football-match to see what they'd
be like in earnest if they're like that at play,' said
Sarah.</p>

<p>'Then I 'ope I shall never see 'em so,' repeated Mrs
Clay.</p>

<p>'And that's what you wanted to do&mdash;amuse yourself
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
with the sight of infuriated Yorkshiremen?' said
Sarah, whom some demon seemed to possess that
evening.</p>

<p>Horatia turned indignantly to her. 'I didn't do it
for any such reason. I suppose you think I meddled,
and perhaps I did; but I only did it as your friend,
Sarah, and I don't think you're very nice,' she said.</p>

<p>'I can't think w'at's come to you, Sally! Don't
be so disagreeable. Miss Horatia only means to be
kind, and we're all much obliged to 'er,' said Mrs
Clay.</p>

<p>'Yes, we are,' said Sarah; 'I expect the men meant
mischief; but you have only done good for to-night.
There'll be a row, sooner or later, and then father'll
have to stand firm or lose his position. Not that I
think that would be a bad thing, except for mother's
sake. Still, it isn't every one that would use five
minutes of being a millionaire just to do good to
other people, and you're a good sort, Horatia. So
don't mind what I say. I'm always cross at Balmoral.
I can't breathe here.'</p>

<h5>A VISIT TO CLAY'S MILLS.</h5>

<p>The next morning dawned bright and sunny, as
Sarah saw when Naomi drew up her blinds.
She also saw that the girl's face was swollen
with crying. 'What is the matter, Naomi?' she
asked anxiously, for Sarah was very kind-hearted,
and she was very fond of her young maid.</p>

<p>'It's Ruth, miss; she's been took with the croup,
and mother's been up all night with her, and the
doctor says he doubts if we shall pull her through.
And, oh, she's such&mdash;a&mdash;darling, is Ruth!' Here
Naomi burst into tears again.</p>

<p>'Poor little Ruth! I'll go and see her to-day,
Naomi, and ask if there is anything we can do for
her,' said Sarah; and she dressed with more alacrity
than usual, in her desire to go and visit Naomi's
home.</p>

<p>Horatia was always up earlier than Sarah, and
generally went for a run in the park before breakfast.
She had just come in and was sitting at the breakfast-table
chattering with Mrs Clay when Sarah appeared,
and, with a hurried 'Good-morning' to them both,
plunged into the subject of which she was full.
'Naomi's sister is ill, mother. I'm going to see her
this morning, so will you, please, go to the mills with
Horatia?' she said.</p>

<p>Mrs Clay looked a little vexed. 'Your father will
be grieved if you don't go, Sarah. 'E thinks you
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
might go to your own mills sometimes, instead of
always goin' to your uncle Howroyd's,' she protested.</p>

<p>'They're not my own mills. I have nothing to do
with them. If I had I'd soon alter them,' Sarah
replied hotly. 'Besides, Uncle Howroyd's mill is a
pleasure to go over; my father's are a pain.'</p>

<p>'Oh Sarah, you do say such things! An' w'at-ever
you mean I don't know 'alf the time. I'm sure
there's no need to go over more of the mills than you
like. You can stop before you get a pain, if that's
w'at you mean,' Mrs Clay added doubtfully, for Sarah
had begun to laugh.</p>

<p>'It's not a pain in my body, mother; it's a pain in
my mind that they give me.&mdash;But I would have gone
with you to-day, Horatia,' she observed, turning to
her schoolfellow, 'if my maid Naomi's sister had not
been taken ill; but I must go and see how she is.
And I shall take Naomi with me, and let her have a
holiday for the rest of the day,' she announced.</p>

<p>Mrs Clay did not rebuke her daughter for taking
it upon herself to give a servant a holiday, any more
than she did for settling her plans for the day without
any reference to her mother; but only said plaintively,
'W'at's the matter with little Ruth? I suppose it's
nothin' catchin', or they'd 'ave told me first; but
still, I do think I should be more use than you,
Sarah; you don't know anythin' about sickness.
W'at 'as Ruth got?'</p>

<p>'Croup, and I thought I'd take her some jelly or
something; children always like jelly,' said Sarah.</p>

<p>'Jelly&mdash;when the poor child can't swallow, very
like! You'd better by 'alf let me go, Sarah; the
poor mother'll not 'ave a moment to talk to you if
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
the child's really bad, an' you'll only find yourself
in the way. You go with Horatia to the mills, an'
I'll call at Mickleroyd's an' do w'at I can do for 'em.'</p>

<p>'Martha Mickleroyd won't stand on ceremony with
me, and I'm not so ignorant as you think about
croup. You have to put the child in hot water.
We had first-aid and domestic lessons at school.
Besides, I promised Naomi I'd go, so I must,' declared
Sarah in such a determined tone that Mrs Clay, who
never could oppose any one for long, gave way with
a sigh.</p>

<p>Horatia had been looking from one to the other,
listening with her quick, eager look to the conversation,
and longing to join in it, but half-afraid for fear
of vexing Sarah; but now she could no longer resist
the temptation. 'Can't we all go on our way to the
mills? I should like to see a mill-hand's cottage, and
I needn't go into the sick-room at all.'</p>

<p>Mrs Clay looked relieved. 'I'd far rather 'ave it
so, Sarah. You don't know for certain that it isn't
'oopin'-cough or somethin' o' that sort. Women are
that ignorant,' she declared.</p>

<p>'Martha Mickleroyd isn't ignorant; she's a very
clever woman, and no more ignorant than&mdash;lots of
ladies,' Sarah finished hurriedly. She had nearly
said, 'than you are,' but luckily remembered in time.</p>

<p>'I believe that; but it isn't every lady that knows
as much about illness as I do; an' as Miss 'Oratia 'ere
wants to go to see a mill-'and's 'ome'&mdash;&mdash;Mrs Clay
was saying.</p>

<p>But Sarah broke in with impatience, 'One would
think we were Hottentots or savages, or something,
by the way Horatia talks!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
Horatia coloured as she answered, 'Oh, but indeed
I don't; you quite mistake me. Father is very much
interested in the housing question, and all sorts of
things that have to do with the poor, and putting
stone baths in their houses, and all that will make
them healthier,' she explained eagerly.</p>

<p>'Very kind of your father, I'm sure, my dear; but
I think you'd better not talk about stone baths for
the Mickleroyds. Mark won't 'ave it. 'E won't,
indeed; 'e told Luke Mickleroyd so,' said Mrs Clay.</p>

<p>Sarah's lip curled. 'If that child has no bath to
be put into it will die, and it'll be his fault, then,' she
observed, as she rose from the table.</p>

<p>'No, it won't; it'll be the fault of its mother, who
hasn't a small bath in her house,' said Horatia.</p>

<p>Horatia had spoken on the impulse of the moment,
without any thought of contradicting or annoying
Sarah; but the latter cast her a furious look, and
then, drawing herself up, said, 'When will you be
ready to start?'</p>

<p>Horatia felt crushed by Sarah's manner; but it
was so uncomfortable to start out in the morning in
this way that she determined to try to conciliate
her. 'Don't be horrid and up in the clouds
above us all;' and she took Sarah's arm with a
coaxing smile.</p>

<p>Sarah could not help smiling, for this was an old
school accusation which Horatia had made when
Sarah once asked how she looked proud and haughty,
and the girls had all laughed at it. 'I don't feel
there; I've told you that before; but you can't or
won't understand how I hate and despise it all.'</p>

<p>'Well, never mind; let's go and see those Mickleroyds.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
You don't hate and despise them,' said
Horatia.</p>

<p>Half-an-hour later the party in the motor stopped
at the point of the main street from which a 'ginnel'
or alley led to the Mickleroyds' house, in one of
the oldest parts of the town, and quite near the
mills.</p>

<p>Luke Mickleroyd, as will be remembered, was the
chief watchman of Clay's Mills, and could have afforded
a nice little house in the suburbs on the tram-line,
for he earned good wages; but he found it more convenient
to be close to the mills, so that he could rest
between his rounds, and in cold weather warm and
refresh himself during the night.</p>

<p>'What a funny old place! I wonder they don't
pull it down,' said Horatia, as she picked her way
over uneven and broken paving-stones to the house,
which had steps, with no balustrade, leading down to
an open cellar-door and up to another door.</p>

<p>'It belongs to my father,' said Sarah curtly.</p>

<p>Horatia said no more, and determined not to make
any comments whatever she saw, 'not even if the
paper were hanging off the walls and the place in
ruins,' she said to herself.</p>

<p>But once they were inside the cottage the scene was
changed. Everything was spotlessly clean; the walls
were prettily papered; the furniture was handsome
and old-fashioned; and Maria Mickleroyd came forward
with a pleasant smile on her tired, anxious face.
'Pleased to see you, Mrs Clay, and Miss Sarah; and
you've brought Omi,' pronounced 'Oh my,' to Horatia's
amusement. 'That's main kind of you. Little
Ruthie's dropped off into a lovely sleep for the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
minute; but, thank you, I shall be glad to have Omi
for the day, if Miss Sarah is sure she can spare her,
for I shall be up to-night again, and I might rest a
bit by-and-by. Luke's resting now.'</p>

<p>'No, I'm not resting, missus,' said Luke Mickleroyd,
coming down a narrow staircase. 'I've had my sleep,
and was coming to take a turn at watching. I ought
to be good at that, seeing it's my trade; but Miss
Sarah's found us some one better, I see, in Omi.'</p>

<p>'We're glad to know the child is better, Luke,'
said Mrs Clay, as she added some suggestions about
the child's treatment. 'An' now we're goin' on to
the mills; but if the doctor orders anythin' special, or
Ruthie fancies w'at you can't get, be sure an' send up
to us. The master won't grudge you that. An' if
you want Naomi the night, keep 'er, so long as we
know. Jane Mary could come wi' the message after
the mills are out. A walk would do her good.'</p>

<p>'Jane Mary won't come nigh Balmoral,' put in
Naomi suddenly.</p>

<p>'How'd thy tongue, Omi!' said her father, and
Naomi subsided.</p>

<p>'Jane Mary should do w'at she's told; she's too
independent,' said Mrs Clay, and, with a short 'Good-morning,'
they all went off.</p>

<p>Sarah turned to wave a friendly farewell, whereupon
Mrs Clay said, with some irritation, 'It seems
to me, Sarah, that folk 'ave only got to be nasty to
your father for you to like 'em. It's not much
good goin' on like that. You know w'at the Bible
says: a 'ouse divided against itself cannot stand.'</p>

<p>'I wonder if that's true,' said Sarah gravely.</p>

<p>'Sarah, 'owever dare you!' exclaimed Mrs Clay;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
and even Horatia looked rather shocked at this
remark.</p>

<p>'Oh, I'm not talking about the Bible; of course I
believe that. I meant what you said,' explained
Sarah. But this was not much better.</p>

<p>'Thank you, Sarah. W'atever I said, I 'ope it was
true. I'm not in the 'abit of tellin' untruths.' Mrs
Clay had forgotten what she had said.</p>

<p>'You only said what you thought, and we can all
make that kind of mistake. I only meant that I
wonder whether I do like people better if they dislike
father.'</p>

<p>'Then you ought to be ashamed of yourself, for 'e's
a good father. An' look at all these mills; every
brick is 'is an' built by 'im&mdash;'is money, I mean&mdash;an'
thousan's of poun's' worth of wool goods sent out
every week&mdash;well-made goods, too, as every one will
tell you. 'E's a wonderful man is your father, an' one
to be proud of, not despised. Most girls would 'old
their 'eads 'igh for bein' 'is daughter, not 'old it 'igh
to despite 'im.&mdash;Oh, good-mornin', my men! good-mornin'!'
Mrs Clay exclaimed, as the gates were
thrown open for them to enter, and she saw some
men crossing the yard.</p>

<p>The men replied by a surly 'Good-morning;' one
or two touched their hats, but the most of them
took no notice of the master's wife and daughter
at all.</p>

<p>Mark Clay met them at the door of his private
office, a plainly furnished little room, the same now
as it had been thirty years before, when it had been
just built. 'This is my private room,' he said.</p>

<p>Horatia looked round with interest. 'It's a very
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
business-like-looking room,' she said, after searching
in vain for something more complimentary to say.</p>

<p>'That's the biggest compliment you can pay it,
and it is a true one, too. There's millions have passed
through my hands in this room,' he said proudly.</p>

<p>''Ave you 'eard that Luke Mickleroyd nearly lost
his little Ruth in the night?' said Mrs Clay. 'We've
just been to see 'em an' leave Naomi there.'</p>

<p>Mrs Clay never liked to take the responsibility of
doing anything herself; but Mark Clay turned to her
more angrily than Horatia had ever seen him, and
said, 'I won't have you go to the hands, encouraging
them in independence and idleness. You call for
Naomi on your way back. Do you hear? She
doesn't get wages for nursing her sister. What's
her mother there for?'</p>

<p>'But, Mark, the mother's got the 'ouse to clean
an' meals to cook; they're such a large family, an'
useful to us,' protested Mrs Clay.</p>

<p>'I don't care. I won't have it, I say. I shall have
the other girl wanting her day off; so you do as I
tell you. If the mother can't see to the girl, let her
go to the hospital. What do I pay to the hospitals
for if it isn't for them to be useful to me? You can
tell her so on your way home, and take Naomi back
with you to her work,' blustered Mark Clay.</p>

<p>'Oh, are we going straight home? I thought we
could, perhaps, go to Fountains Abbey to-day, and you
would come with us?' cried Horatia.</p>

<p>Sarah shot a quick look of surprise at her friend,
who added, 'You said I might choose what I liked
best to do every day, didn't you, Sarah?'</p>

<p>'Of course,' said Sarah.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
'But, my dear, w'yever didn't you mention it before
we started? We would 'ave taken a picnic-basket
along wi' us,' cried Mrs Clay.</p>

<p>'That doesn't matter, Polly; send Fox for it while
we're looking over the mills. That's a good idea of
the lass. We'll all go to Fountains. Do you go and
telephone to them to put in plenty of champagne
and lemonade for the girls,' said the mill-owner
boisterously.</p>

<p>Mrs Clay hurried off to the telephone to give her
directions, while Mark Clay started with the two
girls over the mills.</p>

<p>'I couldn't write an essay on this,' said Horatia, as
they were hurried through yard after yard, on each
side of which were doors which the millionaire just
ordered to be opened, and into which they gave a
peep as he told them, 'In there there's thousands of
pounds' worth of rags and wool for blankets,' or
'cloth,' as the case might be.</p>

<p>'My father doesn't want you to; he only wants you
to see what a huge business he has. I hope he has
succeeded,' said Sarah.</p>

<p>Horatia was saved the trouble of answering, for
they now entered the room where the machinery
drowned every sound. 'Doesn't it make them deaf
or make their heads ache?' she shouted at length to
Mark Clay.</p>

<p>'Make me deaf? No fear; I don't stop in here
long enough,' he replied, misunderstanding her, and
not imagining it was the workpeople she was
thinking of.</p>

<p>And again Horatia was silent.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></h3>

<h5>THE MILLIONAIRE'S PICNIC.</h5>

<p>'Oh dear! my head aches, at any rate,' sighed
Horatia when they came out of about the
fiftieth room. 'I am glad we are going
motoring; it will blow my headache away.'</p>

<p>'Ay, it's a big place, is Clay's,' said the millionaire
with an air of satisfaction.</p>

<p>'There's Uncle Howroyd. I'm going to ask
him to come with us to-day,' observed Sarah
abruptly.</p>

<p>'What's he wanting?' inquired his half-brother.</p>

<p>Whatever Mr William Howroyd wanted with the
millionaire, it did not seem important, for he stopped
when Sarah met him, and the two went off together,
away from Clay's Mills; and Mr Clay, after waiting a
moment to see if his brother was returning, turned to
Horatia. 'If you'll excuse me, young lady, I'll give
some orders for this afternoon, and tell them to have
some pieces done, ready for me to see when I come
back. That's the way to get rich, my lass; look after
the pieces and the bales'll look after themselves.'
And the millionaire, with a hoarse laugh, went off to
'look after the pieces.'</p>

<p>Horatia stood at the door looking after him, and
scarcely noticed a man who half-smiled and raised his
hat. She supposed that he was a man with some
manners, which the rest of them did not seem to possess;
she had no idea that it was a personal attention to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
her till he said, 'We're much obliged to you for
making t'master listen to us. It's saved a lot o'
trouble for the minute.'</p>

<p>Now, Horatia, as will have been noticed, acted and
spoke upon impulse, so she now asked eagerly, 'What
trouble has it saved? And why has it only been
saved for the minute? Were you all going to strike
if he hadn't seen you?'</p>

<p>'Can't say what we mightn't have been obliged to
do,' said the man.</p>

<p>'I don't see how you are obliged to do anything
unless you like; but was that what they wanted you
to do?' persisted Horatia.</p>

<p>'That was one thing. But, see here, missy, if you
can speak a word for us, do 'e. They say you can do
a lot wi' the master; he's a bit too hard wi' us, and
the young uns won't stand it. That's where the
trouble will come in.'</p>

<p>'What kind of trouble?' inquired Horatia.</p>

<p>The man did not look at her. He was gray-haired,
and had been at Clay's Mills for twenty years, and
had an affection for the place. Besides which, he was
'used to the master's ways,' and knew that a good
workman earned good wages and need not fear being
turned off so long as he did good work; but the
younger men hated Mark Clay, and there were fewer
old men there than in most mills, for the moment they
got ill or showed signs of feebleness in any way
they were discharged. Mark Clay lost more than he
gained, for they would have kept the younger ones in
order. But all this the man did not say to Horatia;
he only repeated, 'I can't say what they might not
do when their blood's up.'</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
'But tell me what they say they'll do.'</p>

<p>'Strike,' said the man. 'But you'd best not repeat
that,' he added, almost regretting his confidence, and
going off for fear of adding more.</p>

<p>'There's a fool's trick you've been at, Sam,' said a
comrade, 'a-telling that young lady what the men
say. She'll repeat it all to the master.'</p>

<p>'I never breathed a word of their threats. I only
said they'd strike, and he knows they've threatened
that before.'</p>

<p>'You didn't say a word about what them young
lads said they'd do&mdash;you know what?' the other
demanded. 'They'd be turned off to-morrow if he
got wind on 't.'</p>

<p>'D' ye think I'm a fool? Of course I didn't. But
I'll tell you what. They've got som'at in their
heads at Balmoral, for that young lady kept on
asking what they would do and what trouble there
would be if the master didn't do what we asked
him,' retorted the first speaker.</p>

<p>The second looked gloomily before him. 'It'll be
a bad day for my Tom if them words of his get
repeated to the master; and it's nought but lads' hotheaded
talk; they don't mean it.'</p>

<p>'I'm none so sure o' that, mate; but it's best to
forget it. Anyway, the master's off gallivanting for
the day, and mayhap it'll take his mind off the mills
a bit. If he'd do that more frequent it 'u'd be better
for all&mdash;better for him and better for us,' the man
wound up gravely.</p>

<p>In the meantime Sarah had gone to meet her uncle,
and invited him to come motoring.</p>

<p>'Me! Nay, lass; I've other fish to fry. I'm not a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
millionaire like Mark, able to go away and amuse
myself all day.'</p>

<p>'Now, uncle, you know that's nonsense; you can
get away far more easily than father, because you
are not in such a frightful hurry to get rich. Besides,
you can always stop your work to do an act of
charity, and it is a real act of charity to come with
us to-day,' declared Sarah, tucking her arm in her
uncle's.</p>

<p>'Indeed! How's that? Is Tom Fox, the chauffeur,
ill, and have I got to do his work?' inquired Mr
Howroyd.</p>

<p>'No; and if he were, one of the other chauffeurs
could take his place. You've got to come and sit
beside me, so as to prevent any one else sitting beside
me, because you are the only one I can bear to have
near me,' explained Sarah.</p>

<p>'Upon my word, if I were not your old uncle I
should feel quite flattered,' said Mr Howroyd in a
joking way; but he grew grave as he added, 'But as
it is, my lass, I'm sorry to hear you talk like that.
What's wrong with the others, eh?'</p>

<p>'I don't know that there's anything wrong with
them. I think it's me that there's something wrong
with,' replied Sarah.</p>

<p>'But I don't understand. Didn't you tell me Miss
Horatia was to be of the party? What's gone
crooked between you two?' he inquired.</p>

<p>'I don't know; at least, it sounds silly, but I can't
bear her being such friends with father. She seems
to think everything he does and says all right, and it
isn't; it's all wrong, and I think it's horrid of her!'
said Sarah.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
'Steady there, my lass. I don't think it's the place
of children to criticise their elders at all, and certainly
not their fathers; and as for this you tell me about
Miss Horatia, why, what would you have her do&mdash;abuse
her host, and talk against him to his daughter?'</p>

<p>'You don't understand, Uncle Howroyd. Just you
come for this picnic, and then see if I am not right,'
begged Sarah.</p>

<p>'I sha'n't think that; but I think I'll come, only I
must go home and change first, and give some orders
for the men,' said her uncle.</p>

<p>'Then I'll come too. I feel as if I shall say something
horrid to somebody if I don't.'</p>

<p>'Then you'd best come along with me, for you'll
be poor company for the others in this mood;' and he
took her back to Howroyd's Mill with him.</p>

<p>An hour later the five started for Fountains Abbey,
with a huge hamper strapped on at the back of the
car.</p>

<p>'It's a pity you don't appreciate good liquor, Bill,
for there's first-class champagne there,' said Mark
Clay as they spun along.</p>

<p>'I don't know that it is, for I couldn't afford it
very often,' remarked his brother cheerfully.</p>

<p>'Pshaw! I've no patience with such rubbish!
You could afford it fast enough if you didn't waste
all your money in pensioning off half your old
incapables and keeping the others at work, and going
on as if you ran a mill for the benefit of the hands,'
said the millionaire.</p>

<p>'So I do, I hope,' replied his brother, with the same
good-humoured twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>'Then I suppose you'll be giving them all the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
profits next, and we shall see you working as a hand
yourself?' said Mark Clay, in a tone that implied his
expectation of such a thing, as, indeed, was the case.</p>

<p>Mr William Howroyd laughed quietly. 'I shall
keep the head of Howroyd's Mill as long as I live, as
my father was before me, and his father before him,
and I shall look after the old folks as they did, and,
as I hope, those that'll come after me will do.'</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment, for Mr Howroyd
was not married, and they wondered who would come
after him. Mark Clay thought the mill should be
made into a company with his; but William Howroyd
had very decidedly declined to entertain that idea.</p>

<p>So it happened that it was with these words in
their ears that they came into sight of the beautiful
ruins of Fountains Abbey, built by those who acted
upon the same principles.</p>

<p>Horatia had sat between Mr and Mrs Clay all the
way; but the minute they arrived she caught Sarah
by the arm and said, 'Come and explore the ruins,
and let us find a place and take a sketch of it.'</p>

<p>'We must stop with the others,' said Sarah.</p>

<p>'Oh no, we needn't; you are only saying that
because you are cross with me, and it's no good,
because I can't help the things that you don't like in
me. And besides, I want to talk to you.'</p>

<p>'How do you know what things I don't like?'
inquired Sarah.</p>

<p>Horatia danced a queer little dance of her own, and
then, coming back to Sarah, said, 'Of course I can
feel when you don't like things, but I can't help that.
Come and have a walk with me; I want to ask you
about something.'</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
There was no resisting Horatia's good spirits, and
it was too glorious a day to quarrel or be disagreeable;
so, after seeing that Mr William Howroyd had
gone off with her father and mother, Sarah walked
along with Horatia. 'What do you want to ask me
about?' she demanded of her friend.</p>

<p>'Well, it's this: why do you hate being rich?' she
asked.</p>

<p>Sarah stared at her in wonder for a moment.
'Was that really what you wanted to ask me?' and
as Horatia nodded her head, she continued, 'What an
extraordinary question! I should think any one
could see why for herself. Do you think it's any
pleasure to eat off S&egrave;vres china, so valuable that a
servant goes in dread of his life lest he should break
a piece, or to have gold plate one is afraid of scratching,
or to be surrounded by stuffy carpets?'</p>

<p>Horatia interrupted her with a merry little laugh.
'How can you be surrounded by carpets?' she
demanded.</p>

<p>'You know quite well what I mean, only you
choose to turn it off with a laugh, and that's one of
the things I don't like about you; you turn things
just the way you choose. And the carpets do seem
to stifle me, though you don't believe it,' declared
Sarah.</p>

<p>'I beg your pardon. I didn't mean to laugh; but
the picture of you surrounded by stuffy carpets did
amuse me so. But one thing I don't believe, and that
is that you really hate being rich,' persisted Horatia.</p>

<p>'You mean that I tell untruths?' replied Sarah.</p>

<p>'No, I don't; I mean that you wouldn't really like
to be poor. I don't believe you'd even like to have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
so little money as we have, though it's plenty for us;
and as for being really poor, I'd just like to see you
try it. At least, I just wouldn't, because I'd hate to
see you miserable, and you would be miserable with
no money and no one bowing down before you and
getting you what you want before you asked for it,
and everything.'</p>

<p>'Well, I've a kind of idea that you will have a
chance of seeing who is right, you or I, one of these
days,' was Sarah's answer.</p>

<p>'I wish you'd tell me why you say that, Sarah&mdash;I
do really,' said Horatia.</p>

<p>To say what she really felt was impossible to
Sarah, for at the bottom of her hatred of her riches
was the feeling that they had been unjustly, if not
dishonourably, obtained, and that other people knew
it and despised them for it, and this was gall and
wormwood to a girl of her proud spirit.</p>

<p>'How can I possibly tell you why any idea comes
into my head any more than I can tell you why I
think it's going to rain to-night in spite of its being
so lovely just now?' demanded Sarah.</p>

<p>'That's quite a different thing. There's a west
wind blowing, and it feels like rain,' said Horatia;
'there's a reason for that.'</p>

<p>'Very well; there's a feeling in the air as if the
home of Clay were going to fall,' retorted Sarah.</p>

<p>'Then there must be some reason for it; and if
you know it I think you ought to try and prevent it
for your mother's sake, even if you would like it to
fall,' said Horatia.</p>

<p>'You think girls can do anything, but you are
wrong; they can't, and I don't know any reason why
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
it should fall, and I dare say it's all imagination.
Why does it interest you so much?' asked Sarah.</p>

<p>'Sarah, tell me, why won't Naomi's sister come near
Balmoral?' asked Horatia abruptly.</p>

<p>'Because she hates my father. Every one isn't so
fond of him as you are,' said Sarah.</p>

<p>'Why does she hate him? Doesn't she work in
his mills?' Horatia inquired.</p>

<p>'Yes, that's one of the reasons. Besides, her young
man was a hand, and was turned off. Father is not
popular with his hands,' said Sarah sarcastically.</p>

<p>'Are you?' demanded Horatia, turning upon her.</p>

<p>Sarah did not answer for a minute, for the question
took her aback; then she laughed. 'No, I don't fancy
I am. They think me proud, and I suppose I am,
though goodness knows what I have to be proud of,'
she said.</p>

<p>'You might be proud of being so pretty, but I
know you are not,' said Horatia. 'I don't see why
that girl should hate your father.'</p>

<p>'And I don't see why you should like him,' returned
Sarah.</p>

<p>'I know you don't, and I am sorry for it and for
lots of things; but it's no good worrying about them
when we are out on a picnic, especially as I am starving
of hunger, as you say here, and I see Tom Fox
waving the flag to show that lunch is ready.'</p>

<p>The millionaire was in the best of humours, paying
his wife attention, telling Tom Fox playfully to be
sure and have a good lunch, and see that his horse
had one too! and joking with Mr Howroyd and
Horatia, and with Sarah when she gave him a
chance.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
'Have you got right yet?' inquired her uncle after
lunch, as they were preparing to go back.</p>

<p>'Not right enough to change places with any one;
but they were better to-day, I must say.'</p>

<p>'Oh, were they? How very condescending you
are! Upon my word, Sarah, you want taking down
a peg badly,' said her uncle, who, however, took his
old place beside his niece.</p>

<h5>A DISASTROUS BONFIRE.</h5>

<p>The return journey, as return journeys after a
day's pleasuring often are, was a much quieter
affair than the drive on the way out. Even
Horatia was rather silent as she sat between her host
and hostess, and Mr William Howroyd seemed lost in
thought.</p>

<p>It was the millionaire who broke the silence with
one of the hoarse laughs with which he generally
prefaced his boastful remarks. 'See that speck
yonder? That's Balmoral, on t' hill; you can see
it for twenty miles round on a clear day like this.
There's not another property in the country that
comes nigh it, though I say it as shouldn't.'</p>

<p>'Is that really Balmoral? Oh yes, of course I see
it; they are making a bonfire of weeds in the park,'
exclaimed Horatia.</p>

<p>Mr Clay leant forward. 'Bonfire of weeds? I
don't see any bonfire. Your eyes must be sharper
than mine,' he remarked; and then turning to Tom
Fox, he said, 'Can you see aught, Tom?'</p>

<p>'No, sir; leastways, not at Balmoral. That fire's
far enough from us,' replied the chauffeur.</p>

<p>'Fire?' cried Mrs Clay, starting nervously.</p>

<p>'Pshaw! Fire! It's a bonfire,' said Mr Clay
very decidedly; adding, 'Put on steam, Tom; we're
crawling. I don't go in a motor to crawl, man.' But
he looked anxiously and uneasily in the direction of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
Balmoral, for he, too, could now see a bonfire or
something.</p>

<p>Mr William Howroyd had said never a word;
but his face grew stern and grave as he leaned
forward.</p>

<p>Sarah looked at him, then towards Balmoral, and
then she turned to him again. 'It's not near the
house, Uncle Howroyd; it's only a bonfire.&mdash;What are
you all so upset about?' she demanded; for Tom, who
was noted for his cautious driving, seemed to have
caught the excitement, and was driving faster than
Sarah had ever known him do.</p>

<p>Mr Howroyd took field-glasses from his pocket,
and fixing them to his eyes, gazed earnestly in front
of him; then he muttered something under his breath.
When he took the glasses away, he had an expression
in his eyes Sarah had never seen there before; but
he did not answer her question, and his niece could
not imagine what had come to her cheery, good-humoured
uncle.</p>

<p>The car was going pretty fast, and Mr Clay seemed
satisfied with the progress they were making for the
next few minutes, as well he might, for it was above
legal speed.</p>

<p>'Uncle Howroyd, we shall be fined, if we don't get
killed first,' observed Sarah, who was surprised that
her uncle did not make some protest against what
she considered reckless speed.</p>

<p>Mr Howroyd did not seem to hear what she said,
and she gave his arm a tug; but at that moment a
red tongue of fire shot up high above the trees in
Balmoral park; and now that they were nearer,
all&mdash;including Mark Clay himself, whose eyesight
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
was not very good&mdash;could see that this was no
bonfire.</p>

<p>'Put on speed!' he roared to the frightened Tom
Fox.</p>

<p>'We're at thirty-five now, sir,' said the man.</p>

<p>'Put on the highest you can,' again shouted Mr
Clay, with a muttered imprecation.</p>

<p>But Mr Howroyd leant forward, and putting his
hand on his brother's arm, said kindly but firmly,
'Nay, lad, we'll be there in a short time now. Think
of the wife and these two lasses. You've no right
to put their lives in danger, even if you think your
property's in danger.'</p>

<p>'They're in no danger,' he answered brusquely, as
he threw off the other's restraining arm.</p>

<p>Horatia, who did not know what fear was, and was
rather enjoying the rate at which they were going,
happened to glance at Mrs Clay, who was really
fainting with fright. 'Oh, Mrs Clay's ill!' she cried
in alarm. 'Stop&mdash;pray stop!'</p>

<p>Whether Mr Clay would have taken any notice of
her or not is doubtful; but Tom Fox, who had reluctantly
put on speed at his master's repeated commands,
took advantage of this excuse to slow down a
little, which was just as well; for, springing up out
of nowhere, as they seem to reckless drivers to do,
appeared a policeman, who commanded them to stop.</p>

<p>'Confound you, man! can't you see my place is
burning?' Mr Clay roared out to him.</p>

<p>'What! Mr Mark Clay is it?' exclaimed the man in
surprise, and in no friendly tone. 'You've no right
to endanger the public in this way, whatever trouble
you may be in.'</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
But Mr Howroyd interfered. 'And you've no
right to stop us longer than to take the name when
it's an urgent matter, Marmaduke,' he said.</p>

<p>The man touched his hat. 'Beg pardon, Mr Howroyd,
I didn't know you were of this party. We reap
as we sow in this world, and Mr Clay's fond enough
of the law when it's on his side and against others.&mdash;Go
on, Tom Fox; only mind, if there's an accident
I'm witness that you were warned,' he said, as he
moved back and let them pass.</p>

<p>'Shall we be fined?' asked Sarah of her uncle.</p>

<p>'I don't know. No; I shouldn't think so in a case
like this, especially as we had luckily slowed down a
bit,' he replied. But he did not seem to care much,
which surprised Sarah, who knew that he did not
care for motoring at all, and was always severe on
wild driving.</p>

<p>'I think we shall. You can't go scorching along
just because some trees have caught fire. People's
lives are more important than a few hundred pounds.
You don't seem to care about us at all,' she protested.</p>

<p>'Don't be so silly and childish, Sarah; and mind you
go straight into the house and stay there,' he replied.</p>

<p>They were now near enough to see that some trees
were burning; but as they were nowhere near the
house, Sarah could not quite understand her uncle's
'fidgetiness,' as she called it.</p>

<p>'How on earth did that tree catch fire,' Horatia
suddenly ejaculated as a tall poplar was seen blazing,
'and after such a wet day as yesterday?'</p>

<p>'I can tell you how it caught fire. It was set on
fire by some of your friends of yesterday; that's how
it's caught fire, and that's their way of saying "Thank
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
you" to me for giving in to them; but they've taught
me a lesson, and one I sha'n't forget, and I hope
it'll satisfy you too, young lady,' replied Mark Clay
grimly.</p>

<p>'I don't believe it. It would be too silly of them,
to begin with; and, besides, why should they burn
the trees? If they wanted to be wicked like that
they'd burn the house,' declared Horatia.</p>

<p>'Ay, so they would have done before now if they'd
had half a chance; but it's too well protected. Why,
there's police in it day and night, and they know it!'
he declared.</p>

<p>'All the same, I agree with Horatia, it does seem
funny after yesterday,' chimed in Sarah from the
back-seat. 'And I can't think how those top branches
caught.'</p>

<p>'No, because you don't know your home as well as
you might,' said her father.</p>

<p>'What does he mean?' asked Sarah of her uncle.</p>

<p>'I suppose he means that the granaries are on fire,
and that they've set the trees alight,' explained Mr
Howroyd, whose face was very white and set, but with
a different look of determination from his brother's.</p>

<p>They were in the park now.</p>

<p>'Turn off to the right, Tom,' said his master.</p>

<p>'Take the women-folk to the house first, Mark,'
pleaded his brother.</p>

<p>'To the fire, Tom. I'll catch the rascals red-handed!'
roared Mr Clay.</p>

<p>'Don't get out; go on in the car,' said Mr Howroyd
to his niece in an undertone; but his advice fell on
deaf ears.</p>

<p>Sarah was excited enough now, for they had turned
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
a sharp corner at an angle, which made Mrs Clay
give a sharp cry, and there in front of them were the
blazing remains of two huge barns and some charred
trunks of trees, while others were still burning.</p>

<p>In the roar and crackle of the flames and the crash
of falling timber, the approach of the motor had not
been heard by the excited and interested crowd who
were watching the progress of the flames.</p>

<p>'Watching! Not one of them raising a hand to
stop it!' muttered Mr Howroyd between his teeth.</p>

<p>Mrs Clay clasped her hands in despair.</p>

<p>The millionaire bounded from the car and was
among them before any one saw him. 'You cowardly
curs, that'll take my money and burn my property!
Off my land, I say! I'll pay you for this! You
shall all be in prison before the week's out! I see
you all, and know you too well, curse you!'</p>

<p>'We haven't done aught to your property. You
can't say we have. We saw the flames in Ousebank
oop o' top o' t' hill, and we ran to see. There's no
harm in that, and you can't have the law on us
for't,' said a big, burly man.</p>

<p>'You're trespassing on my land, every one of you,
and I'll prosecute you for that, if I can't for aught
else. There's plenty of boards to warn you,' said
Mr Clay.</p>

<p>The crowd melted away as if by magic, and they
saw the gardeners trying feebly to check the progress
of the flames.</p>

<p>Their master stood and watched them in grim
silence for a little time. His presence and the disappearance
of the crowd seemed to give them increased
vigour, for they worked with a will now, and crash
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
came down a tree which had just caught and would
have carried on the flames to another plantation.</p>

<p>'That's right; rather late in the day. If you'd
done that earlier it might ha' been better. And
where's the rest of you? There's twenty men in the
grounds somewhere, let alone the house; you could
have had thirty at this, and worsted those scoundrels
if you'd chosen; but you didn't, and I'll not forget
it&mdash;I'll not forget it!'</p>

<p>'The others are guarding t' house, master' said the
head-gardener. 'Sykes wouldn't let a man leave;
he's there&mdash;armed, and swore he'd shoot the first hand
that came nigh the house, let his business be what
it might.'</p>

<p>A grim smile relaxed the millionaire's features for
a moment as he heard this news; but they grew
grim again as he asked bitterly, 'And weren't the
garage and stable men enough to guard the house
without the rest of you, whose business is to keep my
ground in order?'</p>

<p>The man turned back to his work of chopping off
smouldering branches, as he said in a surly tone, 'I'm
here, sir, doing my best, and so's these lads, seven on
'em, and it's no use blaming them that has tried to
help when your property is being destroyed for the
fault of them that hasn't had the courage to do it.'</p>

<p>'Courage to do your work!' said Mark Clay in a
tone of contempt. 'And where's the police?'</p>

<p>They were there, too, now, though where they had
been up to this moment did not seem certain.</p>

<p>'You can stand here now; the harm's done and the
robbers gone,' he said when they came to him. 'Bah!
you're all in the same box.'</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
'Excuse me, Mr Clay, you mustn't bring charges
like that against us,' said one of them.</p>

<p>But Mark Clay took no notice of him or his protest,
but walked back to the motor, where Mrs Clay
and Horatia still sat. 'Home, Tom, as long as I've
got one,' he muttered, as he got in and sat moodily
looking before him, and taking no notice of his white
and shivering wife, or of Horatia, who sat there looking
the picture of misery; nor did he notice, apparently,
that neither Sarah nor Mr Howroyd was of the party.</p>

<p>Tom Fox drove up to the front-door, and Sykes, irreproachable
as usual, came down the steps and helped
his master and mistress out of the car. He gave no
sign of anything at all unusual being amiss, for he
was always very grave, till his master said in a grim
tone, 'Had any visitors, Sykes?'</p>

<p>'No, sir; but we were ready for them if they'd
come,' he then replied significantly.</p>

<p>'Ay, you're true Yorkshire grit,' said his master, as
he passed on into the house in front of his wife, who,
indeed, would hardly have got up the steps but for
Horatia's help and support.</p>

<p>'Oh Sykes! Oh, w'at a dreadful affair this is!'
moaned Mrs Clay.</p>

<p>'We'll have to get rid of them southerners; they
wouldn't face the crowd, and are skulking in the
stable-yard. I told the master what it 'u'd be, but he
wouldn't hearken to me. I'd got my men all ready,
and not one would have disobeyed me. Even Naomi
came home to help, and offered to use a gun if I'd
show her how,' related Sykes, hoping by this tale
of devotion to please his mistress and distract her
thoughts from a sad subject.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
But the effect was disastrous, for Mrs Clay gave a
cry of horror and burst into tears. 'Shoot! W'y
should Naomi want a gun to shoot wi'? 'Oo's she
goin' to shoot? Oh, 'ow dreadful it all is! Shoot,
indeed! 'Oo do you want to shoot, Sykes?' she
asked wildly.</p>

<p>'I don't want to shoot any one, ma'am; no more
don't Naomi. And as the danger's all over now we'd
best say no more about it,' replied Sykes.</p>

<p>'Are you sure the danger's over?' demanded his
mistress. And Horatia asked the same question with
her eyes.</p>

<p>Sykes made her a sign, which she did not understand,
and replied to Mrs Clay by saying in a soothing
tone, 'Yes, ma'am, yes; the danger's quite over, if
there ever was any. There's not a soul inside these
park-gates except those that have a right to be; and,
after all, the master can afford a little loss like this
afternoon.'</p>

<p>Mrs Clay gave a little sigh, and said, 'I think, my
dear, I'll lie down a bit, if you'll stop by me. I
don't fancy bein' alone.'</p>

<p>And Horatia willingly went with her hostess.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></h3>

<h5>NANCY PACKS UP.</h5>

<p>Poor Mrs Clay lay down on the sofa in the
drawing-room and shut her eyes. Horatia sat
beside her, kicking the corner of one of the
rich Persian rugs that lay about the drawing-room;
not that she was in a bad temper&mdash;indeed, Horatia
was rarely in a bad temper&mdash;but as an outlet to her
superfluous energy.</p>

<p>It was pain and grief to Horatia Cunningham to
sit still at any time; but this afternoon, when she
felt so excited and wanted to hear all about the fire,
it was a severe trial to her patience.</p>

<p>Mrs Clay was evidently worn out by the events of
the day. Horatia glanced at her from time to time,
but did not like to break the silence. Great was her
relief, therefore, when a knock came at the drawing-room
door.</p>

<p>Mrs Clay opened her eyes. 'Who can that be?' she
demanded, clutching Horatia's arm in her nervousness.</p>

<p>'Only one of the servants, I expect,' replied Horatia,
looking towards the door, in the hope that it would
be some one with news of some sort.</p>

<p>'But they never knock at the drawing-room door,'
objected Mrs Clay.</p>

<p>'Hadn't you better tell them to come in?' suggested
Horatia, for Mrs Clay lay there, clutching her hand
and talking in whispers, but not giving any answer
to the person at the door.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
'Oh no, my dear. I&mdash;we don't know who it is,'
gasped the poor thing, who was evidently quite unnerved,
and no wonder.</p>

<p>'Shall I go and see who it is? I dare say it is one
of the servants, who did not like to come in and disturb
you, because they know you are resting,' said
Horatia.</p>

<p>'I think you'd better ring for Sykes,' objected Mrs
Clay, still keeping her hold of Horatia.</p>

<p>'I'm sure it's only a servant, perhaps Sykes
himself. I'll only open the door a little bit,' said
Horatia, loosening her hand from Mrs Clay's and
running to the door, which she opened, as she promised,
only a little bit, and then exclaimed, 'Nanny! it's
you, is it? What's the matter?' For it was against
all etiquette for Mrs Nancy to come down to this
part of the house. Moreover, the old nurse looked
disturbed and flurried.</p>

<p>'Excuse my disturbing you, Miss Horatia, but I
couldn't get any one to come, they're all that upset
and put about; but I want to know what train
you're going by. The packing's all done, and you
can start as soon as you like; and the sooner the
better for me,' she wound up viciously.</p>

<p>'What nonsense are you talking, Nanny? Why
should we pack up and go away just because a
granary and a few trees are burnt down? We don't
live in the trees!' said Horatia, laughing.</p>

<p>'It's no laughing matter. If you remember, I said
to you when we first came here that it was no place
for us, and now you see how true my words have
come?' said Mrs Nancy.</p>

<p>'I don't remember any words of yours that have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
come true, and I shouldn't advise you to say that,
Nanny, or they'll think you know something about
it, and, perhaps, did it yourself,' retorted Horatia
jokingly.</p>

<p>Nancy gave a kind of snort. 'Don't you go carrying
your love of a joke too far, miss; and if you
think there's any chance of me being accused, that's
all the more reason that we should go before worse
happens,' she said gloomily.</p>

<p>'Why, Nanny, who would have thought you'd be
such a coward? It's all over now, and we can't go
away all of a sudden like this, even if we wanted to,
and I don't. I want to stop and see what will happen
next, and help if I can.'</p>

<p>'Help! You'll be burnt in your bed before you
can help yourself, let alone any one else,' cried Nancy.
'Be guided by me, miss, and let us take the night-mail.
Sykes says there's one passes about eight
o'clock. We could telegraph at once, and her ladyship
would be delighted to see you. Don't pass
another night under this doomed house.'</p>

<p>'Miss 'Oratia, w'at is it? 'Oo are you w'isperin'
to out there?' asked Mrs Clay.</p>

<p>'It's only Nancy, my nurse; she wants to speak to
me about something. I won't be a minute,' Horatia
answered her; and then, stepping into the passage,
she said hurriedly, 'Nancy, who told you that? Tell
me at once all you know. When are they going to
set fire to the house? To-night?'</p>

<p>'How should I know, miss? I can only say what I
think,' replied the old nurse, whose usually cheery
face was puckered up with anxiety and fright.</p>

<p>Horatia took her nurse by both arms. 'Now,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
Nanny, you've just got to tell me. Do you know
anything, or don't you?'</p>

<p>'I know we're among a lot of savage folk that
don't respect other folk's property, and it's about time
we went home,' declared the old woman.</p>

<p>Horatia gave a stamp of the foot. 'You are
aggravating, Nanny! Do you know of any plot to
burn the house? Because if so'&mdash;&mdash;began Horatia;
but she got no further.</p>

<p>For Nancy broke in with indignation, 'Well, I
never, miss! A pretty pass things have come to
when you accuse me of knowing of plots! As if I'd
mix myself up with their wicked deeds! No, miss, I
do not <i>know</i> anything; but I'm not blind nor deaf,
and I have heard quite enough to make me pack our
trunks,' said the nurse.</p>

<p>'That's just what I want to know. What have
you heard or seen? Do tell me, Nanny. I shall be
much more comfortable if I know,' entreated Horatia.</p>

<p>'We shall both be much more comfortable when we
are back at The Grange,' said the nurse.</p>

<p>'It's no good you turning it off like that, Nanny,
for I'm just going to hold your arms like this till you
tell me, and it's no use your wriggling like that, for
you can't get away; you may be bigger, but you
didn't learn gymnastics in your youth, and so you
are not so strong in the arms as I am.'</p>

<p>'I learnt one thing that you haven't, and that is
respect for my elders,' said Nancy severely, and
trying to look dignified, but failing, as may be
imagined.</p>

<p>'I shall respect you all right if you tell me the
truth,' replied Horatia, unabashed by the rebuke.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
'You don't want me to go carrying tales from the
servants' hall, do you? What do you suppose the
mistress would say to that?' said Nancy.</p>

<p>'Mamma would say you were quite right in this
case, because I am not asking out of curiosity, but
because I really ought to know,' said Horatia.</p>

<p>'Well, miss, if you will have it, you will; but,
of course, I only know what little Naomi has told
me of what she has heard down the town to-day,
and of course it mayn't be true,' said Nancy.</p>

<p>Horatia stamped her foot with impatience. 'Never
mind whether it's true or not; tell me what she said,'
entreated Horatia.</p>

<p>'Naomi says that her sister Maria Jane says'&mdash;Horatia
began to think that the tale was going to be
too complicated altogether, but the old woman went
on&mdash;'that the men say there wouldn't have been a
brick left of Balmoral this morning if they hadn't
been given way to yesterday; and that's your doing,
miss.'</p>

<p>Horatia coloured a little with pleasure. 'Then
what on earth are you making this fuss about? The
danger is over, as you see,' she cried eagerly.</p>

<p>Old Nancy shook her head. 'You haven't heard
the rest. That old stupid&mdash;well, I beg his pardon, as
we're in his house, and you seem to like him, miss;
though how you can, or what you can see in him, and
after how you've been used'&mdash;&mdash;she said.</p>

<p>'Oh, never mind all that, Nanny; do tell me the
rest! Mrs Clay will be calling me again, so pray
make haste!' exclaimed Horatia.</p>

<p>'Well, he goes down to the mills and undoes all
the good you've done by saying it was the last time
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
a mill-hand would put foot in his park, for he built
that to be away from them, and he isn't going to
have his peace disturbed; and it wouldn't do them
any good either, for he'd let them have their way
this time to please you, but it was the first and last
time he'd do such a thing.' Nancy stopped.</p>

<p>'That's not all. Go on, Nanny,' said Horatia.</p>

<p>'Well, Naomi's sister, you know&mdash;she hates Mr Clay,
of course'&mdash;&mdash;began Nancy.</p>

<p>'Why of course?' interrupted Horatia.</p>

<p>'You know that story, surely, don't you, miss?'</p>

<p>'What story? How should I know why Naomi's
sister hates Mr Clay? It's very wrong of her,' said
Horatia.</p>

<p>'So it is; but her young man&mdash;the young man she
was going to marry, I mean&mdash;was turned off by the
master, and'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'I expect he was a bad workman; that's his own
fault,' said Horatia. 'But never mind about that
story. Oh dear! I don't know which story I want to
know. You are tiresome to-day, Nanny. What did
Naomi say?'</p>

<p>'It was her sister. Naomi had nothing to do with
it; she's too fond of Miss Sarah,' said Nancy.</p>

<p>Horatia peeped into the drawing-room. Mrs Clay
still had her eyes shut, and by her breathing Horatia
guessed what was indeed the case&mdash;that she had fallen
asleep; so Horatia gave a sigh, and resigned herself to
listen to Nancy's long-winded tale in the hope of
getting at the truth in time. 'Come and sit on this
seat outside the front-door, it is so hot in the house;
and, besides, I am afraid of some one coming and
hearing you,' she said, leading her nurse to a bench
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
outside the drawing-room window. 'Now, about
Naomi's sister.'</p>

<p>'It wasn't Naomi's sister herself,' began Nancy.</p>

<p>Horatia gave a groan; but so great was her anxiety
to hear the truth that she made a great effort and
controlled herself. Then Nancy went on: 'He said
he'd burn the Clays out of Ousebank, and that they
should have a taste of it this very day, to show Mark
Clay what he might expect if he didn't alter his
ways;' and Nancy stopped again.</p>

<p>'What else did Naomi say?' asked Horatia, who
looked grave enough now.</p>

<p>'She said they'd burn the house next, or try to,
and then the mills; and that's what they will do, and
very likely it'll be this night; and if it isn't, it'll be
to-morrow or the next day. And now perhaps you'll
come home with me,' Nancy wound up.</p>

<p>'Indeed I won't! Fancy leaving friends when
they are in such trouble!' Horatia exclaimed.</p>

<p>'You won't help them by staying. I know you've
done some good; but it hasn't helped, after all, and
Miss Sarah's gone off and left you, and it isn't the
proper place for you at all.'</p>

<p>'I wonder where she is. Do you know, Nanny?'
inquired Horatia, for she had been wondering about
this ever since she had turned round in the motor to
speak to Sarah, and had found that she had vanished.</p>

<p>'No, miss, I don't. I supposed you'd know. At
any rate, she had no call to go away at such a time,
and leave you alone to take charge of her ma, and all
these dreadful things happening. I'm sure her ladyship
will blame me for not bringing you away at
once; and if anything should happen'&mdash;here Nancy
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
threw up her hands in horror as she wound up, 'I
should never forgive myself&mdash;never, whatever the
mistress might do.'</p>

<p>'As we're both going to be burned in our beds,
according to you, you won't have to try to forgive
yourself,' observed Horatia.</p>

<p>'Don't talk so dreadful callous, Miss Horatia; and,
if you don't mind for yourself, you might consider me
that you're running into danger,' protested Nancy.
Not that she cared about herself half so much as she
did for her young charge; but because she thought
this argument might have some weight with Horatia,
who always thought of others before herself.</p>

<p>'You needn't stop if you're afraid. I shall write
to mother to-night and ask her to let me stay alone,'
announced Horatia.</p>

<p>'Miss!' cried Nancy reproachfully.</p>

<p>Horatia gave a little laugh. 'Oh dear! there's
nothing to laugh at, only it always seems easier for
me to laugh than to cry, or else I should cry now. It
is dreadful to think that all this money is wasted,'
she said.</p>

<p>'It isn't wasted yet, and perhaps Mr Clay will see
reason, though they say he's wonderful obstinate;
and if I was you, miss, I'd not meddle any more.
You meant well, no doubt; but, you see, you're
very young, and it hasn't done much good, after
all; and it's best not to interfere in other folk's
business.'</p>

<p>The tears rose to Horatia's eyes. 'I know that.
In fact, I'm afraid I've done harm, and that's one of
the reasons I must stop,' persisted Horatia.</p>

<p>'But you won't tell Mr Clay what I've said.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
Leastways, I didn't say it,' cried Nancy, in alarm.
'Naomi said that her sister said that'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'Oh, never mind who said it. Of course I sha'n't
mention any names, but I shall certainly warn Mr
Clay of what the people mean to do.'</p>

<p>'Then you'll do the very harm you want to stop,'
said old Nancy solemnly.</p>

<p>'Why?' asked Horatia.</p>

<p>'Because it'll only make him more determined.
You don't know these Yorkshire folk; there's
nothing will turn them if they get a thing into their
heads. And let Mr Clay hear that they've threatened
to burn him out of the place, and he'll make the
place too hot to hold them, and they'll pay him out,'
said the old woman shrewdly.</p>

<p>Horatia did not make any reply. She felt that there
was some truth in Nancy's remarks, and she gave a
little sigh as she thought to herself how difficult it was
not to harm where you only meant to do good. At last
she said, 'I won't say anything to Mr Clay; but I'll
have a talk with Sarah, and she shall do as she likes.'</p>

<p>'She won't tell him; she knows him too well,' said
Nancy, and she had hardly uttered the words when
Mrs Clay, who had evidently been dreaming, awoke
with a start, and called Horatia. 'You won't leave
to-night, miss?' the nurse said, in a last attempt.</p>

<p>'No, no; I really couldn't, Nanny; but we're quite
safe, for there are a lot of police guarding us.'</p>

<p>Nancy groaned as she went off.</p>

<h5>AN UNPLEASANT MOMENT.</h5>

<p>Mr Howroyd and Sarah, it will he remembered,
had not been seen since they
arrived at the scene of the fire in the park.
Mr Howroyd had vaulted from the car as soon as his
half-brother; and when the latter made his angry
speech, and sent off the townspeople, William Howroyd
went after them as quickly as he could. But
he had not gone far when he heard quick, light footsteps
behind him; and, turning to see who it was,
he saw Sarah, looking very hot, coming hurrying
after him. 'What do you want, my lass? You
go home. The town's no place for you to-night,'
he said.</p>

<p>'Yes it is, Uncle Howroyd. I want to see Jane
Mary. I'm sure this is some of her doing,' she
panted as she came up to her uncle.</p>

<p>'And if it is, what good will it do you to know it,
even if she owned up, which she won't, you may
be sure?' inquired her uncle, stopping, rather unwillingly,
to talk to his niece.</p>

<p>'Oh, she'll tell me; she's not afraid of me. She
knows I'm on her side,' said Sarah.</p>

<p>'A fine statement that! Then what are you going
to do? Incite them to more outrages? Because, if
that's your intention, you certainly won't come; and
I must say, Sarah, you don't show a very nice spirit
in taking this tone.'</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
'What tone?' demanded Sarah, looking rather
defiant.</p>

<p>'Why, rejoicing in your father's loss, and openly
taking the part of his enemies,' said Mr Howroyd.</p>

<p>'I'm not rejoicing in it; I'm awfully sorry. I
would have given anything to have prevented it;
and it's just to prevent any more that I am going
down to Ousebank,' replied Sarah.</p>

<p>William Howroyd turned and continued his way
towards Ousebank. As it was evident that Sarah
meant to go to the town, it was better that she should
go with him than alone, which he was convinced she
would do if he did not let her come with him; so he
only said testily, 'I never did pretend to understand
women, but you beat every one of them. I don't
know what you do mean; but I'm glad to hear you
are not so undutiful as I thought you were. Not
that you'll do any good by going to Ousebank,
because you'll not turn these people.'</p>

<p>'If you think I'm going to try to turn Jane Mary
because I want to save papa's property for him you
are mistaken, because I don't care a fig if it is destroyed
or not; but I do care about Jane Mary, and I don't
want her to get into trouble, and that's why I am
going to see her.'</p>

<p>'You're a queer girl, Sarah; but I think you'll be
sorry one of these days for the part you're acting
now. Why, that little schoolfellow of yours has a
more friendly feeling for your father than his own
daughter,' observed Mr Howroyd, as the two walked
hurriedly along the path through the park, which
was a short-cut to the town.</p>

<p>'Oh Horatia! You say you don't understand me;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
but I think I'm much easier to understand than
Horatia. She came up here to be my friend and
companion, and sympathise with me, and, lo and
behold! she goes and makes friends with father,
and cares much more for father and mother than
for me,' complained Sarah.</p>

<p>'And I don't blame her,' said Mr Howroyd.</p>

<p>Sarah laughed. 'I wonder you don't follow her
example; but you don't, and you know, Uncle
Howroyd, it's no use your pretending to champion
my father, because you don't really care for him a
bit except from duty, and you like me much better,'
she announced coolly.</p>

<p>'I don't like you at all to-night, and I disapprove
of your behaviour to your parents very strongly. As
I told you before, you will be sorry for it one day,'
said her uncle.</p>

<p>They had reached the outskirts of the park and
come out on the high-road as Mr Howroyd said this;
and about a hundred yards to the right of them,
coming down the hill, they saw a crowd of people,
and heard the murmur of many voices. It was the
townspeople coming from the fire, who had been
longer in coming because they had kept to the drive,
not daring to use the short-cut.</p>

<p>'It's the hands!' said Sarah.</p>

<p>'You'd best turn back, my lass; you can't do
any good, and you're far too young to mix yourself
up with this kind of thing,' her uncle entreated
her.</p>

<p>Sarah shook her head. 'I am going on; but if
you want to go ahead, do; I shall be all right with
these people,' she affirmed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
But this was more than Mr Howroyd could bear.
'Nay, you'll not do that if I can stop it, lass. You
don't want to be the talk of the town, do you? But
whether you do or not, you're not going to have your
way. There'll be scandal enough without Mark
Clay's daughter adding to it by going marching
through the town with the rabble that have just
burnt her father's barns,' said Mr Howroyd; and he
quickened his steps to avoid being caught up by the
rabble, as he called them.</p>

<p>But in spite of his efforts, the crowd behind gained
on them, and they heard the foremost say, 'It's
William Howroyd, that's who it is. He's a different
man to his brother, that he is. He'd never turn
us out of his park, wouldn't Mr William.'</p>

<p>'He's got Clay's lass with him, though. What
d'ye say lads, shall we let her come into t' town
if he won't let us go into his park, or shall we turn
her back same as he did us?'</p>

<p>There were mingled shouts of 'Let her be!' and
'Nay, nay, let's turn her back, same as he did us,
and teach him a lesson!'</p>

<p>They were close behind now, and Mr William
Howroyd could no longer pretend not to hear what
they said. The road was wide, and bordered by
banks and hedges. He took Sarah by the hand
and pulled her up on to the bank with him; but
even in that moment he noticed that her hand did
not tremble in the least, but was, as a matter of fact,
steadier than his own.</p>

<p>'I'm not going to run away from them, Uncle
Howroyd. I'm not a bit afraid of them,' she protested,
as he pulled her up after him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
'You do as I tell you; but you couldn't run away
from them if you wanted to,' he replied.</p>

<p>Sarah stood on the bank beside her uncle, and
waited for the crowd to come up to them. They
were only about fifty in all, and mostly young men,
and they seemed undecided what to do when they
saw Mr Howroyd standing upon the bank by the
roadside, with his niece beside him.</p>

<p>William Howroyd's pleasant, cheery face was graver
than most present had ever seen it, as he stood and
watched the men come up and stand, half-sheepishly
and half-defiantly, in a kind of irregular semicircle
round them.</p>

<p>As none of them spoke, except in murmurs to each
other, Mr Howroyd decided to break the ice, and
began, in his brisk, ringing voice, which had a very
stern tone in it to-night: 'Well, men, what do you
want of me? I've made way for you to go forward.
Why don't you go?'</p>

<p>'We want a word with you first, Mr Howroyd,'
said one of the foremost, who had already shown
himself to be antagonistic.</p>

<p>'I want no words with men who break the laws of
the land,' replied William Howroyd sternly, and as he
said this some of the men remembered that he was a
Justice of the Peace.</p>

<p>'We've broken no laws, Mr William. We never
set the barn afire, and you can't prove that we did,'
said one rather anxiously.</p>

<p>'You stood by and let it burn; and you forget that
it was my brother's property,' he replied.</p>

<p>'Mark Clay's no blood-brother of yours. We've
nought again' you, Mr William.&mdash;Let 'im be, lad;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
he've allus right on his side, and he's a good master,
is Mr William,' said an older man, walking on.</p>

<p>'Noa; but we've summat again' Mr Clay, and I say
let the Clays stop in their park&mdash;they want it to
themselves, and let 'em have it; but we won't have
'em in Ousebank,' said the first speaker in a surly
voice.</p>

<p>'The park's private property, and you've no right
there, and my brother had a right to turn you out
to-night. I'd have done the same if you'd come into
my house; but we're all equal on the public road,
and if you molest us here you'll answer for it to me
in another place,' said Mr Howroyd with determination.</p>

<p>All this time Sarah had stood beside her uncle, her
eyes flashing, but giving no other sign that she was
moved by the discussion; but she now said, 'The
men are right, Uncle Howroyd. I will go back to
Balmoral;' and she turned to go up the hill.</p>

<p>Poor Mr Howroyd might well say he did not understand
women, for this was the last thing he had expected
Sarah to do, and it embarrassed him very much,
for he wanted to get to the town as soon as he could
and stop possible disturbances; but it was impossible
to let Sarah return to her home alone on an evening
like this. He stood looking first at the crowd,
which was now passing on, and then at Sarah, doubtful
which to accompany, when the question was decided
for him by a man in the crowd, who came forward
and said, 'I'll see Miss Clay home, Mr William; you'll
be wanted down Ousebank to-night.'</p>

<p>'Mickleroyd!' cried Mr Howroyd in amazement.
'You here! I didn't expect to see you among this
lot.'</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
William Howroyd feared no man, and 'said his
mind,' as he was wont to express it, and he was far
too popular for it to be resented, perhaps because his
'mind' had never anything but kindness in it, though
it was very truthful.</p>

<p>'I'll answer for my presence here if need be, Mr.
William; but let me take the young lady home.
She'll be safe with me, and the town'll be safer if you
are there,' said the old man, with sturdy independence.</p>

<p>'I'll come, Luke.&mdash;Good-night, uncle,' said Sarah,
deciding the question, as usual, for herself.</p>

<p>'Good-night, Sarah. I'm glad you're going home;
your mother'll be worrying about you, I'll be bound,
and she'll want some one to comfort her,' said her
uncle as he turned to go down the hill.</p>

<p>'Oh, Horatia's doing that, I've no doubt. I can't
think why she wasn't me, and I her. She'd have
liked to live at Balmoral,' replied Sarah.</p>

<p>'She's a good young lady, Miss Sarah, and, if you'll
excuse me, she's done the master a mint of good.
It's what he wants, some one to say a word in
season, and make him a little softer like,' said Luke
Mickleroyd.</p>

<p>'You're all alike, Luke; you think there's no one
like Horatia Cunningham, and I can't think why
except that she has a pleasant way of saying things,'
said Sarah a little bitterly.</p>

<p>'It isn't only that, miss; it's that she's got a lot of
heart. But I know you've got a heart too, and a
heart of gold; only I often think 'tis a pity some
people cover it up so carefully that it wants a lot of
digging to come at,' remarked the man.</p>

<p>'I suppose you are talking about me; but don't I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
show you any feeling, Luke?' asked Sarah rather
reproachfully.</p>

<p>'Yes, miss, of course; and I wasn't thinking of you
at the minute, as it happened. I'm sorry I said what
I did about Miss Cunningham if it annoyed you, for
I know from Naomi how kind you are, and what a
true friend to all our family. If I said anything, it
was because I was thinking 'twas a pity you didn't
take things as the other young lady does, for if you
had very likely matters would never have come to
this pass.'</p>

<p>Sarah did not answer a word, and the two walked
on in silence. Luke Mickleroyd was thinking bitterly
of the part his daughter Jane Mary had taken in
the day's work, and Sarah's thoughts were not more
pleasant.</p>

<p>'I dare say you're right, Luke; but one can't
change one's character. If a person's born proud
and horrid like me she can't help it; it's her nature
to be so,' she said after a pause.</p>

<p>'There's something above nature, Miss Sarah; and
though I'm not one to preach, I know you know
better than me, not being a scholar, that you can be
changed,' replied the man.</p>

<p>Sarah was so surprised at such a speech from a
mill-hand that she found no words to reply; but
when he had left her, by her desire, at the back of the
house, she made her way to her room by the back-stairs,
and taking up her favourite attitude on the
wide window-seat, sat and gazed out over Ousebank.</p>

<p>'I hate them all! I hate Ousebank, and the mills,
and the hands&mdash;the ungrateful people; they turned
against me even, though they know I have always
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
taken their parts and sympathised with them,' she
burst out. Then the words of her uncle came back to
her that she would one day regret the attitude she
had taken up, and she wondered whether she didn't
regret it a little now. And then Luke Mickleroyd's
remarks haunted her, and with a sudden impatient
movement she got up and went to the door. There
she paused irresolutely, and then, half-shamefacedly,
she turned back and knelt down by her bedside; and
after ten minutes she got up and walked swiftly out
of the room and down the stairs, wondering rather at
have said; and though she said her prayers night and
morning as a matter of habit, she did not remember
ever having prayed in the daytime before.</p>

<h5>SARAH'S FIRST STEP TO CONQUEST.</h5>

<p>Sarah walked swiftly along the passages, her
head erect, her colour a little brighter, and
her lips half-smiling instead of being curved
in a contemptuous droop; and on her way she met
Naomi.</p>

<p>'Oh miss!' cried Naomi, and then stopped short,
and looked curiously at her young mistress.</p>

<p>'Well, Naomi, what is it? What are you looking
at me like that for? Has anything more happened?'
demanded Sarah.</p>

<p>'No, miss; thank goodness there's nothing more
than you know, and that's enough, and too much. I
was only thinking you look rare and beautiful this
evening,' blurted out the maid.</p>

<p>'What nonsense, Naomi! I'm just hot and red,
and you don't like pale people,' replied Sarah; but
she was pleased all the same; for though she was not
in the least vain of her good looks&mdash;which she would
have exchanged willingly for Horatia's parentage&mdash;she
liked to be admired, and she walked on, feeling
very satisfied with herself.</p>

<p>Naomi looked after her admiringly. 'There's not
a young lady can hold a candle to her in all the
county. But wherever's she going? Why, that's
not the way to the drawing-room; she's going to the
master's room. Well, it isn't often she pays him a
visit, and it mostly ends badly, if it doesn't begin so.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
How she comes to be his daughter I can't think; she's
too good for the like of him. I'd sooner have believed
she was a duke's daughter,' she soliloquised.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Sarah, conscious that she was doing a
noble action in conquering her own feelings, walked
on, as Naomi had said, to her father's special sitting-room,
which he called his study, but in which his
only study was how to make more money.</p>

<p>Sarah tapped at the door, and her father's voice
growled something which she took to be an invitation
to come in, so she opened the door and entered the
room; but on the threshold she paused and hesitated.
Her father was sitting in his big easy-chair in front
of his bureau, writing. He did not look up at once,
thinking it was a servant, who could wait his pleasure,
and Sarah had time to notice his forbidding expression.
It seemed to her that her father had never
looked more unlovable, as he sat there with a scowl
on his face, writing no doubt letters to the police or
whatever authorities he wished to invoke aid from
to punish the incendiaries; and as he wrote such a
malignant and fierce expression came over his face
that Sarah made a movement to retreat; but the
noise she made in doing so attracted Mr Clay's attention,
and, looking up sharply, he exclaimed, 'What!
you, Sally?' and laid down his pen to hear what his
daughter had to say to him.</p>

<p>'Yes, father; I came to tell you how sorry I am
about all this affair to-day,' she said.</p>

<p>Mr Clay looked keenly and a little suspiciously at
his daughter. She stood there, looking so like a culprit
apologising for her misdeeds, that the thought
flashed across him that perhaps she had something
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
to be sorry for. She made no secret of her sympathy
with the 'hands,' and she had not expressed sorrow or
indignation at the time, so that the mill-owner may
be excused if he believed for the moment that she
had had something to do with the fire.</p>

<p>'Are you sorry?' he asked dryly. 'I thought you
didn't care if I lost every penny of my money.
That's what you always say. Are you sure you're
not sorry that your friends are going to get into
trouble, eh? I suppose you didn't know anything
about it beforehand? Because, you know, I sha'n't
make any exceptions. Those that burn my property
shall pay for it.'</p>

<p>'Father,' cried Sarah indignantly, 'how can you
think such a dreadful thing of me? If that's what
you think, I'm sorry I came to you at all;' and she
turned to go.</p>

<p>'Stop a minute, my lass,' said her father. 'I'd like
to get to the bottom of this. Why did you come?'</p>

<p>'I came to tell you I am sorry for your loss,' said
Sarah half-sullenly.</p>

<p>'You are sure you didn't come to beg these people
off their punishment?' persisted Mr Clay.</p>

<p>'Yes, I am quite sure of that. I should never
waste my time asking you to show mercy to any
one,' cried Sarah, her eyes flashing.</p>

<p>Mark Clay looked at his daughter with an angry
light in his eyes. 'I'm glad you've got so much sense,
my lass,' he said coldly, and went on with his writing.</p>

<p>Sarah hesitated a minute. She was sorry for the
words the moment they were out of her mouth. It
was a miserable end to her attempt at making friends
with her father; but her father's head was bent over
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
his writing, and his face had on the stubborn look
she knew so well, so she reluctantly turned away, and
went back to her own room.</p>

<p>'He means mischief,' she said as she leant her chin
on her hands. 'He's more dangerous when he is
quiet like that than when he blusters.'</p>

<p>How long she sat Sarah did not know, until she
was startled by hearing the dinner-gong clanging
through the house. She gave a violent start, and
looked round to see if Naomi had put out her dress
for dinner, and saw, to her surprise, not only that
she had not done so, but that it was the dinner-hour,
so that either dinner must be late&mdash;an unheard-of
thing in that house&mdash;or she had not heard the
dressing-bell, and this must be the dinner-gong.</p>

<p>'But where is Naomi, and why was my dress not
put out for me?' Sarah asked herself, and in answer
to her unspoken question Naomi appeared.</p>

<p>'Oh Miss Sarah, I'm so sorry; I've fair forgot
everything to-day, with all the upset! Oh miss, do
let me dress you quick!' she cried, in great distress.</p>

<p>'It's the dinner-gong, then?' inquired Sarah.</p>

<p>'Yes, miss; there hasn't been any other. Sykes he
forgot to ring the dressing-bell; the first time in his
life, he says, that he ever did such a thing. The only
one that's gone on the same as usual is the French
<i>chef</i>, and, of course, he doesn't care a bit about us
English folk. All he said when he heard about this
was, "Vell, he got plenty money build more barns;
but if his dinner isn't to the minute he'll swear,
and so there it is, ready to dish." So pray make
haste, Miss Sarah, for master's sure to be upset easy
to-night,' Naomi wound up.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
'Naomi, was Jane Mary in this?' inquired Sarah
abruptly.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that they both alluded to the
incendiarism as 'this.'</p>

<p>Naomi replied, 'I couldn't say, Miss Sarah. I
couldn't say anything for certain about it, on any
account.'</p>

<p>'You mean you won't; and that means that you
don't trust me,' replied Sarah.</p>

<p>'No, indeed, miss; I'd trust you as soon as I would
myself. But it's the real truth; I don't know anything,
nor I won't know anything. And if I was
you I'd do the same. It'll be the safest way and
the best in this business,' Naomi told her earnestly.</p>

<p>Sarah sighed. 'It's going to be a bad business
for those that do know anything about it,' she said.</p>

<p>'It would have been worse if some of them had
had their way,' observed Naomi.</p>

<p>'Then you do know something about it?' exclaimed
Sarah.</p>

<p>'I know what they're all talking about, but what's
true and what's false I couldn't tell you.'</p>

<p>'Is my mother dressed for dinner?' inquired Sarah
suddenly, abandoning the attempt to pump Naomi.</p>

<p>'No, Miss Sarah; the mistress has been lying down
ever since she came in, with Miss Horatia.'</p>

<p>'Lying down with Horatia?' ejaculated Sarah.</p>

<p>'I mean lying down, with Miss Horatia sitting
beside her holding her hand like a daughter,' Naomi
corrected herself.</p>

<p>Sarah coloured violently, and Naomi wondered
what made her do so. Poor Sarah was being made
to feel all round what a poor sort of daughter she
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
was, and she felt irritably that it was only since
Horatia came that this fact had been obvious. But
Sarah was wrong. Her attitude towards her parents
had always been noticeable, and her brother and
mother had constantly upbraided her with it; but it
was Horatia's coming which had brought this home
to her, and she did not like it.</p>

<p>'That will do, Naomi,' she said, giving an impatient
tug to the sash that the maid was tying, and she ran
lightly down the corridors and the wide marble staircase
to the dining-room.</p>

<p>Mr and Mrs Clay and Horatia were all there, and
dinner was begun; and Sarah noticed, to her annoyance,
that all three were dressed in the clothes they
had worn for the picnic. 'Oh, you haven't changed!
I have; that's why I am late.'</p>

<p>'We were all too upset to think of dress; we're
not like you, above caring about these things,' said
her father bitterly.</p>

<p>'Sarah thought you wouldn't like to see 'er in 'er
dusty clothes, Mark; an' I would 'ave changed too,
only I was so tired I thought you'd excuse me; an'
Miss 'Oratia 'ere was too kind to leave me alone, my
nerves bein' upset,' put in Mrs Clay in order to shield
her daughter, and really making things worse by contrasting
Sarah's conduct with Horatia's.</p>

<p>'Yes, she's a good, kind lass, is Miss Horatia,' said
Mr Clay, giving her a friendly look, as he pressed
some favourite dish of his on her.</p>

<p>Sarah had dreaded dinner, being of the same opinion
as Naomi that her father would be upset. Indeed,
he had looked very much upset and ready for an explosion
when she left him in his study; but it was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
'Horatia again,' she said to herself, and she thought
angrily that Horatia cared nothing about those poor
people who had got themselves into trouble.</p>

<p>She was angrier still when Horatia replied, 'I'm
not at all good or kind at this minute, for I should
like to put all those people I saw in the park into
prison.'</p>

<p>'You'll have your wish before long, little lass, for
that's where they'll all be,' said Mr Clay.</p>

<p>'Oh, but I shall be very sorry if they really do go
to prison. I only wished it from revenge, and, of
course, that's a very wrong motive,' cried Horatia.
She looked across at Sarah to help her; but Sarah
would not look at her friend or join in the conversation
at all.</p>

<p>'I don't know whether it's a wrong motive or not,
but I do know that it's necessary to punish those
wretches for destroying my property; and punished
they will be,' Mr Clay replied.</p>

<p>'There wasn't many o' 'em really doin' that,
Mark,' said Mrs Clay timidly.</p>

<p>'They were doing as bad, standing by watching
the destruction; and I'll have every man of them
clapped into prison,' said the millionaire.</p>

<p>Mrs Clay said no more, and Horatia began to
chatter about other things, amusing both Mr and
Mrs Clay by her shrewd remarks.</p>

<p>Sarah sat sullenly by, and when dinner was over
she went straight up to her room instead of joining
the others in the drawing-room. 'They prefer Horatia
to me, so let them have her. I'm sure she's welcome
to do daughter,' Sarah said to herself. Perhaps finding
her place usurped awakened Sarah to the know
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>ledge
that she had a place to fill in her home, and
that she was not filling it.</p>

<p>The next day Mr Clay went down to his mills as
usual, and no word had been said about the events of
the day before; but Sarah was not deceived. Her
father, she was sure, was planning his revenge, and
sooner or later he would, as he had said, clap his
enemies into prison.</p>

<p>Naomi could give her no information on the subject,
and Mr Howroyd refused point-blank to discuss
the matter. 'You'll hear all there is to hear in time;
but it may come before me to be heard, and I can't
discuss it with you or any one else.'</p>

<p>The next morning came a very polite letter from
Lady Cunningham to Mrs Clay, thanking her for all
her kindness to Horatia, and begging that she might
return in time to pay a visit to some relatives, who
desired that she might accompany her parents, as she
was a great favourite.</p>

<p>'I don't wonder at that, my dearie; you'd be welcome
anywhere, with your bonny bright face,' said
Mrs Clay.</p>

<p>'I sha'n't let you go unless you promise to come
again soon,' said Mr Clay, with a heavy attempt at
humour.</p>

<p>'Oh, but I am coming! I've enjoyed myself immensely,'
cried Horatia willingly.&mdash;'Good-bye, Sarah.
I shall be so glad to see you back at school. We
shall be friends again then as we used to be, sha'n't
we?'</p>

<p>'I don't feel as if anything were going to be as it
used to be,' said Sarah; but she kissed Horatia very
affectionately when they parted.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
'I believe it's your doing that mamma sent for us,
Nanny,' said Horatia when the two were in the train.</p>

<p>'And if it was, I'm not a bit ashamed of it,' said
Nancy stoutly, 'for I couldn't have stayed another
night there, starting and trembling at every sound,
and dreaming shocking dreams of being burnt alive
in my bed.'</p>

<p>'It's awfully selfish of us to come away and let
them be burnt alive in their beds, if you think it's at
all likely,' remarked Horatia.</p>

<p>'Then I'll have to be selfish, for I don't consider
it's any part of my duty to stop and be burnt with
them, which it's their own fault in a way, for they
do say that Mr Clay's made himself fairly hated by
his ways.'</p>

<p>'I don't hate him,' observed Horatia.</p>

<p>'No, miss, so I saw; but however you put up with
him and his common ways, let alone his hasty temper,
I can't make out. Well, we've seen the last of them,
thank goodness! so I'll say nothing against them,'
remarked Mrs Nancy with satisfaction.</p>

<p>'I've promised to go and stay with them again
soon,' observed Horatia.</p>

<p>'That's if her ladyship allows it,' replied Nancy,
in a tone that implied that the mistress wouldn't
allow it.</p>

<p>Horatia only laughed. 'It will be nice to see them
all again,' she said. And this time she meant her
own family.</p>

<h5>CLAY'S MILLS PLAYING.</h5>

<p>Sarah was sitting in her own room, rather cross
with herself for feeling lonely, and trying not
to acknowledge, even to herself, that she missed
Horatia, or to own that her schoolfellow made things
go more smoothly, somehow. It was a stormy-looking
morning, and Sarah was wondering what she should
do with herself, when she felt a gentle hand placed on
her shoulder, and, turning in surprise, saw her brother
standing behind her, with his usual pleasant smile on
his face.</p>

<p>'Good-morning!' he said, as he kissed her.</p>

<p>'Goodness me, George! Where on earth did you
spring from?' she cried in surprise. 'I thought you
were in Scotland.'</p>

<p>'So I was till yesterday; in fact, I've only just
arrived,' he remarked.</p>

<p>'You've been travelling all night, and you look as
fresh and clean as if you'd just dressed for breakfast!
But that's just like you. I believe you'd be miserable
if you had your hair untidy or your face dirty,' she
observed.</p>

<p>'It certainly isn't a pleasant idea. Besides, there
is no need for it in this case, seeing that they provide
plenty of hot water in the through sleeping-car,'
remarked George, seating himself on the window-seat
opposite his sister.</p>

<p>'All the same, I should think it would be pleasanter
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
to travel by day. And what brought you back a
week before your time?' Sarah demanded.</p>

<p>'I thought I should like to have a last look at the
old home,' he replied dryly. 'I have more affection
for it than you have, you see.'</p>

<p>'How did you hear about it?' inquired Sarah.</p>

<p>'I saw something in the papers, and wired to Uncle
Howroyd, and he said I had better come back. I
meant to come in any case, though, as soon as I saw
the papers,' explained George.</p>

<p>'What did the papers say? I haven't seen one,
and no one will tell me anything. Uncle Howroyd is
worst of all, because, he says, he's a magistrate; but I
suppose it's just because I am only a girl, since he
will talk to you,' said Sarah.</p>

<p>'He only told me the real facts of the case, and
said he thought my place was at home, if only to
comfort my mother.' Here George paused a moment,
and then continued, 'She seems to miss that little
Miss Cunningham. She's been rather lonely these
last two days.'</p>

<p>There was a tone of reproach in his voice, and
Sarah answered quickly, 'I've been too miserable and
worried to talk to any one.'</p>

<p>'I'm afraid the pater will be in a terrific rage about
it,' replied George; and, having made his reproach, did
not recur to it.</p>

<p>'Will be in a rage? What do you mean? He has
been in a rage ever since it happened. He ought to
be cooling down by now; but I don't suppose he'll do
that till he's got them all in prison,' replied Sarah.</p>

<p>'Then you don't know?' inquired George.</p>

<p>'Know what? Have they been tried and let off?
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
It's too bad of Uncle Howroyd not to tell me, and I
wanted so to know,' cried Sarah.</p>

<p>'They can't get a case against them. No one will
give evidence, not even the head-gardener; he says he
didn't see how the fire began, and it might have been
burning weeds that caused it,' said George.</p>

<p>Sarah laughed. 'I am glad!' she exclaimed in a
tone of delight.</p>

<p>'I'm not. It's a very disgraceful thing that a
man's property should be destroyed and no one
punished,' said George, with unwonted sternness.</p>

<p>'But father said he'd prosecute them all for trespassing,'
observed Sarah.</p>

<p>'You'll be glad to hear that he has been told that
no magistrate would convict; it's something about
a right of way,' said George.</p>

<p>'George, I am sorry they did it; but I do think he
has provoked them, and he is hard to his workpeople,'
said Sarah.</p>

<p>'I know; but this isn't the way to make him better.
In fact, I am afraid they've enraged him so that
goodness only knows what will be the end of it,' said
George gloomily.</p>

<p>'I suppose you'd mind dreadfully if we did lose all
our money?' suggested she.</p>

<p>'Of course I should; and so would you, whatever
nonsense you may talk to the contrary!' cried George
testily. 'And it's to do what I can to smooth matters
down and prevent any such catastrophe that I have
hurried home. Not that I can do much good,' he
wound up.</p>

<p>'Oh George, it would be jolly to live in a little
cottage, and do as one liked, and dress as one liked,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
and not have to sit for hours over long, stupid meals,
and have to walk half a mile from your bedroom to
the dining-room!' cried Sarah.</p>

<p>'You'd be a nice one in a cottage! You'd want
the whole of it to yourself to begin with; and as for
doing what you like, you would not be able to do
that if you were poor any more than, or nearly as
much as, if you were rich. You'd have to keep the
house clean, and do the cooking, and be a drudge.
How would you like that, pray?' he inquired.</p>

<p>'Lovely!' said Sarah with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>George looked at her curiously, with a half-amused
expression. 'I only hope you mayn't be put to the
proof, but it wouldn't surprise me. However, I
mustn't stop here talking; I want to see the governor.
I suppose he's gone to the mills?'</p>

<p>'Yes; but I don't advise you to go there after him.
You know he's always in a worse humour in the
morning than he is in the afternoon when he's had
some lunch. Wait and see him then. We might go
down to the rink father had made on purpose for
Horatia. I think he'd have got her the moon if she
had asked for it,' observed Sarah.</p>

<p>George laughed. 'She was very nice to mother.
By the way, if you really want to skate, I'll go and
tell her; she'd like to come down and watch us, and
the walk would do her good.'</p>

<p>'All right,' agreed Sarah, as her brother went off
to fetch his mother.</p>

<p>'It was so kind o' your father to 'ave this floor
laid. 'E's good enough to people if they only take
'im the right way, only 'e mustn't be crossed; 'e never
'as been. Oh deary me! w'at 'e'll do now that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
they've crossed 'im in this business, I don't know. 'E
says 'e'll best 'em yet, for 'e's never been bested
by any man, an' doesn't mean to be,' said Mrs Clay
as she walked along, clinging to her son's arm.</p>

<p>'I dare say he'll calm down in a day or two. It is
very irritating. He can't "best" the law, as he calls
it,' said George in a soothing tone.</p>

<p>'Well, there's no fear o' 'is goin' against the law,
for 'e doesn't 'old wi' that,' said Mrs Clay.</p>

<p>'Then we may console ourselves that his "besting"
will be legal, in which case no harm will come of it,'
said George with a smile, as, having put his skates on,
he gave his hand to his sister and took her for a round.</p>

<p>Mrs Clay sat on the raised stand, and watched the
two as they skated round and round, doing all sorts
of figures, and performing rinking feats for her
special benefit, as she was well aware.</p>

<p>'Beautiful, my dears&mdash;beautiful! But, oh, do be
careful! Suppose you were to fall an' break your
pretty noses or legs, or anythin'!' she ejaculated at
intervals.</p>

<p>The two skaters laughed heartily at this last
remark. 'I believe you would care more about our
noses than our legs, mother,' said Sarah, 'though they
aren't half so important.'</p>

<p>'There's nothin' so important to a woman as good
looks&mdash;except bein' good,' said Mrs Clay seriously
when they stopped to rest for a few minutes beside
her.</p>

<p>After a couple of hours they went back to lunch,
and found their father had just come back from the
mills. He greeted George in a friendly enough
manner.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
'I got your telegram, my lad, thank you; and it's
nice of you to hurry home to stand by your dad in
his fight. For I suppose that's what you've come
for, isn't it?'</p>

<p>'Yes, father, certainly, as I told you in my telegram.
I only wish I had been there; they wouldn't have got
off scot-free, the scoundrels!' replied George.</p>

<p>'That's the right spirit, my lad. I wish you had
been there; but I've got the best of them. They
didn't know Mark Clay when they tried that game
on with him; but they'll know him better now,' said
the mill-owner.</p>

<p>'What have you done, sir?' inquired George, in his
calm way, which gave no sign of his secret anxiety
on the subject.</p>

<p>Mark Clay gave a chuckle, which made Sarah feel
very uneasy; but only said, 'You'll see, my boy&mdash;you'll
see. Just wait till the end of the week. It'll
be public property then, and folks will see whether
Mark Clay's an easy man to beat.'</p>

<p>George avoided looking either at his mother or
Sarah; for, truth to tell, he felt very uncomfortable.
This cheerfulness on the part of his father boded no
good. But he asked no more questions, and talked
about the sport he had had in Scotland.</p>

<p>'George,' said Sarah after lunch, 'what's he up to?'</p>

<p>'I don't know,' replied her brother, too depressed
to comment upon her mode of expression.</p>

<p>'Well, I believe I know. He's going to turn them
all off. You see if he isn't. That's what he means
by saying, "Wait till the end of the week." Oh dear!
oh dear! What a business there'll be! There were
at least a hundred in the park that day.'</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
'It's their own fault. But that would be cutting
off his nose to spite his ears, wouldn't it? It would
inconvenience him dreadfully to dismiss so many men
at once,' objected George.</p>

<p>George, it will be observed, knew even less of his
father's business than Sarah, whose visits to her
uncle Howroyd's mill and her acquaintance with the
Mickleroyd family gave her some knowledge of the
working of the mills; so she answered now, 'Oh, he
won't care. He'll shut a workroom up and make the
others work harder. You may trust him for not
inconveniencing himself; it's the people who will be
thrown out of employment that I am sorry for.'</p>

<p>George did not argue the matter with her, but
walked off to see his uncle, who had nothing consoling
to say to him, except that he would stand by them
whatever happened.</p>

<p>'And what do you suppose he expects to happen?'
George asked his sister, rather irritably, when he
returned.</p>

<p>'Goodness knows! All I know is that I shall be
glad when this week is over,' she replied.</p>

<p>But Sarah was wrong, for when the time came
there was no gladness at Balmoral.</p>

<p>'You were right, Sarah,' said George, coming in
and throwing himself down on a cane armchair
in the garden, near where his sister was sitting
reading.</p>

<p>'I generally am,' said Sarah lightly. She and her
brother were great friends in spite of their abuse of
each other.</p>

<p>'It's no joke,' he replied seriously; and Sarah,
looking to see what was the matter, was struck by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
her brother's grave looks. He was coming out in
quite a new aspect.</p>

<p>'What's no joke? Oh, do you mean that I was
right about father's revenge?' she inquired.</p>

<p>'I don't know about its being a revenge; but he's
turned out that crowd that looked on at the fire, and
the hands have revenged themselves by striking, and
Clay's Mills are "playing."'</p>

<p>It should be explained that 'playing' in the north
country means not working, and a very serious thing
it is, especially in a large mill.</p>

<p>Sarah dropped her book, and sat there, open-mouthed,
looking at her brother. 'Clay's Mills "playing"! Our
hands have gone out on strike?' she gasped.</p>

<p>Her brother nodded silently. 'Of course they'll
have to give in; the governor can hold out longer
than they can; but it means a terrible loss,' he said
at length.</p>

<p>They were sitting there staring blankly at each
other when they heard their father's voice. Both
started as if they had been caught doing something
wrong, and instinctively looked round to see if there
was any possibility of escaping without being seen;
but they saw that this was impossible, for Mr. Clay
was making for them.</p>

<p>'Oh George! he'll be in a towering rage. You talk
to him. I'm sure to say something to irritate him,'
said Sarah in a hurried undertone.</p>

<p>'He doesn't look much upset,' observed George; and
just at that minute the millionaire came within hearing,
and called out a cheery 'Good-morning' to them.</p>

<p>'Well, my lad, I've got rid of a lot of bad material
to-day,' he remarked jocosely.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
'You mean the hands, father?' said George, as he
rose and politely placed a chair for his father.</p>

<p>'Yes, I mean the hands,' said Mr Clay, mimicking,
with little success it must be owned, his son's soft,
drawling tones and refined accents.</p>

<p>'I'm sorry you found them all bad material,'
George replied, without noticing this.</p>

<p>'I didn't say I did; but part of it was bad, and as
the good wouldn't stay without the bad, out they
both had to go, and bitterly they'll rue the day they
did it,' declared Mr Clay.</p>

<p>'I hope you won't,' burst out Sarah.</p>

<p>Her father looked as if he were going to get into
one of his violent rages, but refrained, as he had done
lately; and again Sarah could not help noticing the
change that had taken place since Horatia's coming,
though Horatia had not been able to prevent him
from doing this latest act. 'I hope not; Clay's Mills
sha'n't "play" for them,' he said quietly; but there
was a satisfied look on his face that Sarah could not
understand.</p>

<p>It was Saturday, and all that day and all Sunday
the millionaire went about looking aggressively
cheerful. 'He only does it just to annoy us,' said
Sarah.</p>

<p>'It doesn't annoy me. I'm only too glad to see
one cheerful face in the midst of so many gloomy
ones, though I should like to know what it means,'
said George.</p>

<p>'So should I, for Naomi says father has a big
contract on, and will lose thousands every day he
stands idle,' said Sarah.</p>

<p>George looked very serious. 'What can he be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
thinking of? He must be going cracky,' he
opined.</p>

<p>'Oh no, he isn't,' said Sarah a few minutes later;
'he's done them, somehow. Look!'</p>

<p>George looked out of the window. 'The mills are
working!' he exclaimed. 'How has he done it?'</p>

<h5>'FURRINERS' IN OUSEBANK!</h5>

<p>The young Clays stood and stared at each other
in blank amazement. Then they looked out
again at the cluster of tall chimneys which
belonged to Clay's Mills, and which were belching
forth great volumes of smoke as if in contemptuous
defiance of those who had dared to try to stop their
mighty engine.</p>

<p>'It is our mills!' repeated Sarah, as if she had
almost disbelieved her eyes.</p>

<p>'Yes, there's no mistake about it; they are our
mills; and yet I could have vowed I saw some of the
hands pass by the park-gate this morning when I
went to speak to the park-keeper. They were going
away from Ousebank in search of work, I supposed.'</p>

<p>'I expect you are mistaken. How could the mills
work without the hands? Unless they climbed down,
and I'm sure they won't do that. Besides, you don't
know their faces, do you?' asked Sarah.</p>

<p>'I guessed who they were by the way they glared
at me; it made me pretty uncomfortable,' said George.</p>

<p>Sarah looked at her brother, who was smoking a
gold-tipped cigarette. 'You don't look very uncomfortable,'
she observed.</p>

<p>'Oh George! Oh Sarah! Do you see that the
mills are workin' again?' cried Mrs Clay, her lips
trembling, as she came into the room where her
children were.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
George put his arm round his mother. Even Sarah
was moved to be demonstrative, and, taking her
mother's hand, fondled it.</p>

<p>'What is it, mother? Why does that frighten you
so? It is a very good thing, though I don't know
how it has come about,' said George gently.</p>

<p>Mrs Clay only shook her head. She made no reply,
but stood gazing out over Ousebank, her eyes fixed
on the cluster of chimneys that belonged to their
mills. They had finished the firing probably, for the
chimneys were not smoking so violently now, but
some smoke was still coming out.</p>

<p>Sarah seemed very thoughtful, and soon left the
room to go in search of Naomi. 'Have the hands
gone back, Naomi?' she asked abruptly.</p>

<p>'You've seen it, then? Our lads haven't, I know.
I can't make it out at all. I'd give something to
know what's happened; but now that none of the
townspeople are allowed farther than the park-gates
we hear no news at all,' replied Naomi.</p>

<p>'Naomi, I must know how they've managed it. I
shall come down the town with you,' cried Sarah.</p>

<p>'Very well, miss. I'll be ready in two minutes,'
said Naomi, and went off.</p>

<p>On her way she met Mrs Clay, who looked relieved
at meeting her, and remarked, 'Oh Naomi, just tell
Miss Sarah that Mr Howroyd 'as 'phoned to say that
none of us are to go into the town to-day.'</p>

<p>'None of us, ma'am? Do you mean not even me?'
inquired Naomi, looking blank.</p>

<p>'Oh, you! No, you won't matter; they won't 'urt
you,' said Mrs Clay, quite severely for her.</p>

<p>Naomi returned slowly to Sarah's room. 'Mistress
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
says no one is to go into the town to-day, by Mr
Howroyd's orders, except me; so, please, miss, may I
run down and find out what it all means?'</p>

<p>As may be imagined, Sarah did not understand this
message at all; but when Naomi had explained as
well as she could, her young mistress said with
decision, 'I'm coming with you, Naomi. Something
dreadful is the matter. I expect they are burning up
all the fuel, or doing some damage to the mill.'</p>

<p>'Please, Miss Sarah, don't be angry, but I daren't
take you. It's as much as my place is worth, and
you might get roughly handled if the lads are angry
with the master,' said Naomi.</p>

<p>'You need not take me, but you can't prevent me
from going with you. In fact, if you like you can
start first. I will go alone,' persisted Sarah.</p>

<p>Naomi would have liked to argue with Sarah; but
she knew it would be a waste of time, so she went
off, and instead of making herself smart, she caught
up a shawl, threw it over her head, and ran down the
back-stairs and out at the back-door as quick as she
could.</p>

<p>'No, you don't!' cried a voice behind her, and a
strong hand grasped her shoulder none too gently.</p>

<p>With a little cry Naomi turned, to see herself confronted
by Sykes, who exclaimed, 'Whatever are you
up to, Naomi? I thought you were a mill-lass, and
we don't want none of them up here.'</p>

<p>'So I am for the moment. Let me pass, Mr Sykes.
Miss Sarah wants to know what's on in Ousebank.'</p>

<p>'No good, I'll warrant; and don't get mixing up
with it,' was the butler's parting remark as he released
her.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
Naomi sped across the park; but what was her
surprise to see ahead of her, running as fast as she
could, another mill-lass! Naomi made after her
quickly, meaning, if she were a friend, to ask what
was doing in Ousebank, and, if not, to demand her
business at Balmoral. 'Wait a bit, lass,' she called
out when she got near enough to be heard; but the
girl only ran on faster. She was tall and slender, and
not unlike Jane Mary, Naomi's sister; and the thought
struck Naomi that if it was her sister, she was after
no good. 'Jane Mary,' she shouted, 'if you don't
stop I'll heave this stone at you!'</p>

<p>The figure in front stopped at this threat, and
turned.</p>

<p>'Miss Sarah! I beg your pardon, miss; I didn't
know you,' cried Naomi in surprise.</p>

<p>'Now that you do know me, and see that I
mean to go to Ousebank, perhaps you'll drop that
stone&mdash;it might have killed me if it had fallen on
my head&mdash;and let me walk beside you instead of in
front.'</p>

<p>Noami looked rather guiltily at the stone in her
hand, and dropped it, saying apologetically, 'I thought
it might be some one up to no good. But do you
suppose they won't know you, miss?'</p>

<p>'You didn't,' observed Sarah with a laugh.</p>

<p>'Not your back; but all Ousebank knows your
face, and they'll maybe turn nasty to you,' Naomi
warned her.</p>

<p>'They'll be too busy to stare at a mill-lass, and I
shall keep as well behind you as I can.'</p>

<p>Naomi looked doubtfully at her mistress. 'Perhaps
if you were to tie this handkerchief round your face,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
as if you'd got toothache, you'd pass better,' she
suggested, handing Sarah a large white pocket-handkerchief
with a coloured border.</p>

<p>Sarah took it and wrapped it round her face, saying
as she did so, 'It will make me very hot. But I'll
tell you what, we'll go straight to your house, Naomi;
they will know all about it there, and we sha'n't mix
in the crowd.' Sarah's courage, as may be seen, was
oozing away with all Naomi's warnings.</p>

<p>But Naomi proved a Job's comforter. 'I doubt we'd
better not go home, Miss Sarah. There's Jane Mary
fair off her head, she's that mad with the master, and
she's turned against all of you. She'd think you
were a spy or something, and be nasty as like as not.'</p>

<p>Sarah said no more, and as they had come to the
town now they had enough to do to pick their way
through the crowded streets. 'The mills can't be
working, Naomi. Here are some of the chief hands,'
she said in an undertone.</p>

<p>'I never thought they were. It's some mischief
they're doing. Hark! did you hear what yon man
said?' inquired Naomi in the same tone.</p>

<p>'No; at least, I could not understand, he spoke
such broad Yorkshire. I thought he said something
about "furriners,"' replied Sarah.</p>

<p>'That's what he did say. Oh miss, come into the
ginnel [alley] till these men pass,' cried Naomi, pulling
Sarah into the said 'ginnel,' just in time to avoid
a party of young men, who were evidently very
excited, and were anathematising Mark Clay. 'Miss,
you'd best go to Howroyd's. There's a fine to-do
to-day,' entreated Naomi.</p>

<p>'Perhaps I'd better,' agreed Sarah, who was not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
very happy in her mill-lass's get-up. At no time did
Sarah like meeting the 'hands;' but in this disguise
she disliked it still more. It was only a mad impulse
which made her don the disguise, and she rather regretted
it now that she saw the state of the town.
So she willingly turned towards Howroyd's Mill.</p>

<p>'The master's at the telephone. He's been there
most of the morning, and it's no use your coming
to-day; you'd best leave your message,' said the
maid, who did not recognise Sarah. Indeed, she had
only opened the door a few inches, taking them to be
poor girls come to ask help from the ever-ready
philanthropist, William Howroyd.</p>

<p>'Let me in, Mary,' said Sarah, coming forward and
untying her disguising handkerchief.</p>

<p>The maid gave a little shriek, and grasping Sarah
by the hand, drew her inside. 'Miss Sarah, my dear!
however could you? And the town all against your
father! Come forward! Pray, come forward!'</p>

<p>Sarah very willingly went 'forward,' as they say in
Yorkshire, and gave a sigh of relief as she threw off
the shawl which covered her head, and sank into a
chair. 'What is the matter, Mary? What has my
father done now?' she demanded.</p>

<p>'You don't know? Oh deary me!' cried the maid,
with lifted hands and much shaking of the head.</p>

<p>'No; tell me quick,' said Sarah abruptly.</p>

<p>Mary looked fearfully round, as if the information
was dangerous to give. 'He's got in a lot of furriners&mdash;blacklegs&mdash;to
run the mills,' she said in a hoarse
whisper.</p>

<p>Sarah looked at her in horror, mingled with incredulity.
'Foreigners! How could he? And how
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
could they do the work? Besides, where did he
get them from, and when did they come? It's impossible!'
she cried.</p>

<p>'It's true for all that,' said Mary, nodding her head.</p>

<p>'I must see Uncle Howroyd,' said Sarah. 'Go and
tell him I'm here, Mary.'</p>

<p>'I told you not to leave the house,' was her uncle's
remark when he came in, looking graver and sadder
than Sarah had ever seen him.</p>

<p>'Yes, I know; but I simply had to come, and no
one recognised me. See, I was a mill-lass,' said Sarah,
throwing her shawl over her head to show her uncle.</p>

<p>She looked so pretty and coaxing&mdash;for Sarah could
be charming to those she loved&mdash;that her uncle smiled,
and said with a sigh, 'Well, you're safe enough now
you're here, and I've half a mind to send for your
mother and George. Anyway, I must telephone to
tell them you are here.'</p>

<p>'Oh no, Uncle Howroyd; I must go back for lunch,'
cried Sarah, not adding what was in her mind&mdash;that
her father would be angry if she were not home for
lunch.</p>

<p>'You'll have to stay now you've come, child.
There'll be no going home for you to-day, so you'll
have to do with a plain dinner to-night; and Naomi
had better go back and fetch what you want, unless
I go and fetch them and your mother myself,' replied
Mr Howroyd.</p>

<p>'Do you mean that you think mother isn't safe
at Balmoral?' cried Sarah, starting up.</p>

<p>'I hope so. Do you suppose I should be here and
not with her if she weren't?' demanded Mr Howroyd.
'No; it's only that I doubt if your father will be able
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
to get home to-day, and I thought she'd feel safer with
me.'</p>

<p>'She has George,' said Sarah quickly, for she sometimes
resented other people speaking slightingly of
her brother, however much she might do so herself.</p>

<p>'Ah yes, she has George. Well, I'll just 'phone to
her;' and he went off, only to return in a few minutes
to say, 'You are right; she prefers George, and
George prefers Balmoral. He says I am to tell you
to stop where you are, if it's any use telling you to
do anything.'</p>

<p>'I sha'n't obey George; but as it's Hobson's choice,
I will stay with you, Uncle Howroyd; but, please, tell
me, how did father manage to get foreigners to do his
work?'</p>

<p>'That's more than any one but himself knows; but
he smuggled them into the mills yesterday, and they
slept there all night, it seems; but who they are, or
where they came from, or how they are getting on,
no one knows,' replied Mr Howroyd.</p>

<p>'They can't stop in there always, and the people
will kill them when they come out,' said Sarah.</p>

<p>'Your father will protect them, and so shall I, if it
comes to that; but it's a bad business, a very bad
business; and what will be the end of it, who can
tell?'</p>

<p>'I know they'll burn down the mills&mdash;that's what
always happens&mdash;and we shall be ruined,' said Sarah.</p>

<p>'That won't ruin you, because they are insured,
and let us hope it won't come to that. Besides, the
mills are so well guarded that they can't get near
them,' said Mr Howroyd in a tone which showed that
he had thought of this danger himself.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
Mr Howroyd was now called away, and Sarah was
left to her own thoughts, which were not pleasant
ones. Somehow, when it came to the point, the
thought of her father being burnt in his mill or
ruined by his workpeople's spite was not so lovely,
and she was relieved when Naomi reappeared with a
bundle in her arms.</p>

<p>'I didn't dare to bring a portmanteau, miss, or even
your dressing-bag. I was afraid with all these folk
about ready for any mischief, so I've just brought a
few necessities, as the mistress says; and she sends
her love, and says she's glad you are safe with your
uncle, though she wishes you'd stayed with her.'</p>

<p>'I wish I had, Naomi. Tell her I would never have
come if I had known I should not be able to get
back, and that if she will tell Uncle Howroyd I may,
I'll come home at once,' said Sarah.</p>

<p>Trouble was doing Sarah good, and her affectionate
message did her mother good; though she hurried off
to the telephone to tell Mr Howroyd that she forbade
Sarah to attempt to come home, and to inform him
that Mr Clay was stopping at the mill too.</p>

<p>And so the weary, dreary day wore on, and the
excitement in the streets grew. After nightfall the
older men held indignation meetings in public, where
they had huge audiences of sympathisers, the entire
population being on their side, as a matter of fact.</p>

<p>'Foreigners in Ousebank! We've never had such
a thing before, and we don't want it now,' they all
agreed. As for the younger men, they held meetings
too; but their meetings were held within closed doors,
and what was said at them was not divulged.</p>

<p>'They're brewing mischief they young uns, sir,'
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
said Luke Mickleroyd to Mr Howroyd when he came
in for a few minutes before he took his watch for
the night.</p>

<p>'I'm afraid they are. We must only pray and
trust that they may not carry it out,' replied Mr
Howroyd.</p>

<p>'Ay, sir, that's all we can do. I shall keep a
sharper lookout to-night than I've ever done, and,
please God, they'll be kept from doing harm to others
and bringing sorrow on themselves,' said the good and
pious old watchman.</p>

<h5>OUTWITTED.</h5>

<p>All that night Sarah lay and tossed and turned,
or fell into fitful slumbers, in which she
had hideous dreams of the mills being burnt
down, and her father with them. After a very vivid
one, in which she saw the mill-owner standing, a tall,
burly figure, on the top of one of the chimneys, with
flames all round him which in a minute must devour
him, she woke with a muffled cry, to find Naomi
standing beside her with a frightened face.</p>

<p>'What has happened, Naomi? Tell me the worst
at once,' cried Sarah.</p>

<p>'There's nought to tell, good or bad, so far as I
know. But are you ill, Miss Sarah?' inquired the
maid.</p>

<p>'No; I'm quite well. But the mills, and my father&mdash;are
you sure that&mdash;that he's alive and well?'
asked Sarah.</p>

<p>'So far as I know he is, and so are the mills; but
no one has seen the master since yesterday, for he
never came home last night. He sent to say he
should stop in the mills all night,' said Naomi.</p>

<p>'Naomi, I must get up. Quick, get me some hot
water,' cried Sarah, jumping up as she spoke.</p>

<p>'It's only six o'clock, miss. I shouldn't have come
in and wakened you, only I thought I heard you
call. You'd best go to sleep again; you're upset
with all these doings, and no wonder.'</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
'I can't sleep, and I want to go to the mills,'
declared Sarah.</p>

<p>But Naomi exclaimed in alarm, 'Impossible, miss!
Don't you think of doing such a thing! Mr Howroyd
won't hear of it, I know. Besides'&mdash;here Naomi
paused, and added in a rather embarrassed manner,
'you can't, Miss Sarah.'</p>

<p>'I can't go to the mills&mdash;our own mills, Naomi?
What do you mean? You are hiding something
from me. Are they burnt down or damaged in any
way?' asked Sarah anxiously.</p>

<p>'Not so far as I know, miss; but you can't go into
them for all that. No one can,' repeated Naomi.</p>

<p>'Naomi, have you seen the mills to-day? Are the
chimneys all standing just as usual?' demanded
Sarah.</p>

<p>'Why, yes, to be sure they are, and smoking; and
big fires they are making, too, for I saw red sparks
coming out of one. Why, what's the matter, Miss
Sarah? You must be getting downright nervous,'
observed Naomi, for Sarah had started and given a
little shiver at this last remark.</p>

<p>'It's nothing, only I had a horrid dream about
one of the chimneys; but if you say you saw them
standing, with nothing unusual about them, it's all
right.' And Sarah gave a half-nervous laugh as she
thought of the 'unusual' appearance they had in her
dream. 'All the same, I'm going to get up; it's no
use lying in bed when you can't sleep,' she continued.</p>

<p>While she was dressing, Sarah's thoughts recurred
to the conversation she had just had with Naomi,
and she suddenly remembered that the girl had never
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
explained her mysterious statement that no one could
go into Clay's Mills. So she rang her bell, and telling
Naomi to do her hair, sat down on a chair while this
process went on, and came to the point at once. 'I
suppose father has barricaded himself and the men
into the mills; but I could have got through all
right,' she observed.</p>

<p>'The master has barricaded himself in; but the
pickets set by the hands to guard the mills have
barricaded every one else out, and they wouldn't let
you pass if it was ever so, not for life or death, for
it's been tried,' replied Naomi.</p>

<p>'How do you mean for life or death?' asked Sarah,
bewildered at this extraordinary statement.</p>

<p>'What I say. One of those foreigners was taken
ill and wanted a doctor, and no doctor would they
let through, not even Mr Howroyd; and if any one
could get round Ousebank folk it would be Mr
William, for he's fair worshipped by them all for his
goodness.'</p>

<p>'What's going to be the end of it all?' cried
Sarah.</p>

<p>'I couldn't say, Miss Sarah. I don't know what's
going on, nor I don't want to. It's safest not, and
so mother thinks, for she won't have a word about
it in our house; and Jane Mary has to hold her
tongue there, though they do say she talks like a
man at the young fellows' meetings, and is as bad
or worse than they, egging them on. Not that I
know anything about it,' Naomi hastened to add.</p>

<p>'There are none so ignorant as those that won't
know, eh, Naomi?' said Sarah slyly.</p>

<p>'Perhaps not, miss,' agreed Naomi, as she shut her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
lips tightly, and was not to be induced to say any
more.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the night at Balmoral had not been
much more restful. In the morning George said to
his mother in a decided tone which she had not
heard him ever use, 'I am going into Ousebank,
mother. I shall go and see Uncle Howroyd, and if
he approves I shall try and see my father.'</p>

<p>'Oh my dear, my dear, don't you do it! I couldn't
stay here alone&mdash;I couldn't really!' she cried, wringing
her hands.</p>

<p>'Then come with me. We'll motor down, and at
best they can only stop the car and make us turn
back; but I don't think they will. Come, mother,
that's not a bad idea; it will make a change, and
bring you nearer to the governor, and you will see
Sarah and give her a scolding for her disobedience.'</p>

<p>'I don't feel like scolding any one. I shall only
be too thankful to have her safe by me; though who
knows whether any of us are safe anywhere?' said
poor little Mrs Clay, whom the events of the past
week had frightened out of her wits.</p>

<p>'I think you exaggerate the danger. They may
try to fire the house&mdash;in fact, I rather expect they
will, only I fancy the police are guarding us too well
for them to succeed; but as for touching us or
attempting our lives, I don't for a moment believe
they would do any such thing&mdash;not Ousebank men,'
said George, composed as ever.</p>

<p>'Oh, but it isn't only Ousebank men; there are
some agitators come down,' cried his mother.</p>

<p>'They'll not put their heads in a noose, catch
them, however much they may incite other fellows
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
to. Don't you worry, mother; trust to me. I'll take
you safe to Uncle Howroyd's,' said George.</p>

<p>Mrs Clay meekly did as she was bid. At bottom
she was rather pleased to be going near her husband
and insubordinate daughter, and by the time she
got into the motor her fears were calmed.</p>

<p>Sarah was looking out of the mill-house window
when she saw the car drive up to the big gates of
the little front-garden. 'Mother, oh, I am glad to
see you!' she cried, as she kissed her mother affectionately.</p>

<p>Mrs Clay's pale cheeks grew pink with pleasure
at the affectionate greeting, and she clasped her tall
daughter in her arms. 'My dearie, I am glad to
have you again!' she exclaimed.</p>

<p>'You ought to scold her well, Polly, instead of
petting her; but it is always the way with the
prodigal&mdash;he has the fatted calf,' said Mr Howroyd.</p>

<p>'George says he's going to see his father,' said Mrs
Clay.</p>

<p>'If the pickets will let him,' observed his uncle.</p>

<p>'Exactly so,' said George.</p>

<p>'You can't possibly,' cried Sarah; 'they won't even
let Uncle Howroyd through, so they certainly won't
let you.'</p>

<p>'There's no harm in trying, anyway. I half-thought
they might be unpleasant when we passed
through the town; but they only scowled a bit,'
observed George, as, having made his mother comfortable
in an easy-chair, he kissed her and took up
his hat to go.</p>

<p>'You are really going, dear?' said his mother.</p>

<p>Sarah expected her to protest with tears; but she
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
did nothing of the kind. 'I believe,' mused Sarah,
'that she cares more for father's safety than she does
for George's!' And this idea was so surprising to her
that she, too, let her brother go without a protest.
Not that arguments would have been any good, as
his sister knew.</p>

<p>'That boy has more grit in him than I suspected,'
said George's uncle, as he watched his nephew walk
with his deliberate gait out at the gate towards the
notorious mills.</p>

<p>'I'd have given something to go with him to see
what will happen when they turn him back. George
is awfully obstinate, uncle; I dare say he'll stand
there and argue with them till they let him through
because they're sick of him and his polite requests
to be allowed to go into his own father's mills,'
observed Sarah.</p>

<p>Mr Howroyd laughed, though it was not his usual
cheery laugh. 'He'll be a cleverer fellow than I
take him for if he gets past that picket, will George.'</p>

<p>However, half-an-hour later the telephone rang.
'It's from Clay's Mills,' Mr Howroyd informed them,
'and they're calling for you, Polly.'</p>

<p>'Oh dear, 'ave they 'urt 'im?' Mrs Clay cried, and
flew to the telephone. 'It's George,' she announced
in accents of surprise; 'an' 'e says father is quite well,
an' very glad to see 'im, an' 'e shall stay a bit.'</p>

<p>'How did he get in? Ask him that, mother,' demanded
Sarah, who was naturally curious on the point.</p>

<p>''E says 'e walked in,' repeated her mother.</p>

<p>Sarah went to the receiver herself. 'Nonsense;
he couldn't.&mdash;How did you get past the pickets,
George?'</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
'Walked past, I tell you. They argued a little,
but I told them I was on their business as well as
my own, and they let me walk in. They're awfully
good fellows, really, and you all exaggerate their
ferocity.'</p>

<p>Suddenly Naomi came running into the room.
Howroyd's house was not so ceremoniously ordered
as Balmoral; but still Sarah was a little surprised
at Naomi, till she said, 'There's a balloon-ship up
above Ousebank, and you never saw such a funny
thing in your life. Come and see it, Miss Sarah.'</p>

<p>'I suppose she means an air-ship,' said Sarah; but
as she had nothing else to do, and time was hanging
heavy on her hands, she followed Naomi into the
garden. 'Yes, it is an air-ship,' she said. 'I wonder
what it is doing up here.'</p>

<p>'It's going towards the hill&mdash;over Balmoral. We
shall see where it goes if we go up to the roof,
Miss Sarah,' said Naomi, who had never seen such
a thing before, and was all agog with curiosity.</p>

<p>To please her, Sarah went up to the roof lookout.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p>'Yes, it is over Balmoral, and they seem to be
descending and doing manoeuvres over the house. I
suppose they are going to look at it closer; but they
won't be allowed in to-day, for Sykes is suspicious of
a bird even. We really might be in Russia, to judge
by the state of siege we are in,' she observed.</p>

<p>She had still more reason to make the comparison
a little later, for as the two stood and watched and
commented on the movements of the air-ship something
dropped from it.</p>

<p>'What was that, Miss Sarah?' asked Naomi.</p>

<p>'Fire! They've outwitted us after all!' said Sarah,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
and she fled downstairs as hard as she could.&mdash;Uncle
Howroyd, ring up the fire-brigade. They've set fire
to Balmoral!' she panted.</p>

<p>'How do you know? Who told you so?' he
inquired, evidently unbelieving, as well he might,
for there was a posse of police guarding the house
and grounds.</p>

<p>'We have seen it. They dropped fire out of an
air-ship. Do send for the brigade!' cried Sarah,
stamping her foot with rage at the delay.</p>

<p>For a moment her uncle stared at her in stupefaction;
then he clapped his hand to his forehead.
'It's that agitator scoundrel that's put them up
to it!' he cried; and he rang up the brigade, only
to drop the receiver with a gesture of despair.
'They've had a call some miles off,' he cried.</p>

<p>'Uncle Howroyd, we must do something.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' he agreed. 'Wait a bit.'</p>

<p>Presently Sarah heard the mill-bell ring, and saw
her uncle standing bareheaded at a window looking
on his yard, in which the hands summoned from
their work were gathered.</p>

<p>'My friends of many years, I have to ask a favour
of you. My brother's house is burning, and the
brigade is away. Who'll help to save a Yorkshireman's
home, however much he has blundered, for a
Yorkshire family?'</p>

<p>'We will, Mr William,' cried a hundred voices, and
five minutes later there was not a man to be seen
in the yard; but Sarah and Naomi, who had climbed
to the lookout, saw them hurrying up the road to
the hill on which Balmoral stood.</p>

<p>Flames were coming out of the top windows.</p>

<p>'They may save the lower part,' said Sarah.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p>'The marble staircase won't burn, will it?' asked
Naomi.</p>

<p>Sarah laughed hysterically. 'No; but it won't be
much use alone,' she remarked.</p>

<p>'It's going to be a big fire,' observed Naomi in an
awe-struck voice.</p>

<p>'I'm glad my father is not there,' was Sarah's
apparently irrelevant reply.</p>

<p>Naomi was surprised for the second time that day
at Sarah's solicitude for her father. She did not
know that her dream had something to do with it.
Besides, Mr Mark Clay, boastful and blustering, was
a different man from Mark Clay a prisoner in his
own mills, with his beautiful house burning.</p>

<p>'Oh miss, the royal suite is on fire! See!' cried
Naomi, as she saw the flames come out of that wing.</p>

<p>Sarah said nothing; but her lips tightened as she
saw the wanton destruction of her home, and, now
that she came to think of it, there were countless
treasured possessions of her own there that she
wanted to save.</p>

<p>'I wonder if I ought to tell mother?' she asked
herself.</p>

<p>But she need not have troubled. Mrs Clay knew,
and was talking about it in melancholy accents to
Mary, her brother-in-law's maid. 'It's no more than
I expected, Mary; an' the mills will go next,' she said.</p>

<p>'Let's hope not, ma'am; and now that Mr William's
gone up something may be done to save it,' said
Mary, who had great faith in her master.</p>

<p>But Mrs Clay had no faith in any human help;
and when Sarah came down she found her mother
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
dry-eyed and resigned. 'Yes, my dear, I know; it's
the Lord's will. The Lord gave, an' the Lord taketh
away. I began poor, an' I suppose it's 'is will I
should end so. Per'aps I lay too great store by
riches.'</p>

<p>'Never mind, mother, I'll work for you, and you
shall never want, even if I have to scrub floors to
support you,' said Sarah.</p>

<p>Mrs Clay shook her head; but the tears came now
and relieved her. 'It's for you I care most, dearie.
Your 'ands were never made to scrub floors or do
any menial work,' she declared, as she stroked Sarah's
soft, white hands.</p>

<p>'I don't believe anybody's hands were made to be
idle, and I mean to use mine, you'll see,' she said.</p>

<p>'Per'aps it's not so bad as we think. We must
'ave patience,' said Mrs Clay. 'Go an' see 'ow it's
goin', my dear.'</p>

<h5>GOOD-BYE TO BALMORAL.</h5>

<p>It is always the unexpected which happens. Here
was Mrs Clay taking the destruction of her
cherished possessions quite calmly, and only praying
silently, as Sarah saw, that her husband and son
might be saved. And here was Sarah getting angrier
and angrier as she watched the fire spreading, apparently
unchecked, and swallowing up not only the
costly treasures for which she did not much care, but
her own personal treasures, for which she cared more
than she expected.</p>

<p>Naomi made matters worse by her lamentations.
'To think of all the beautiful carpets and curtains
ruined; and, oh, Miss Sarah! all your dresses, and
that picture in your boudoir that you are so fond of,
some Italian view or something! Oh dear! oh dear!
the more I think of it the worse it seems. It's wicked,
is this morning's work!'</p>

<p>'It's a fine morning for a fire&mdash;the sun shining, and
just a nice breeze blowing to fan the flames,' observed
Sarah sarcastically.</p>

<p>But Naomi did not perceive the sarcasm; and after
a wondering and rather reproachful glance at her
young mistress, she remarked, 'It's what I call a bad
morning; but, then, I suppose you're glad, because
you want to be poor; though how you can stand there
quiet-like, and see all your poor ma and pa's things
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
burnt up, let alone everything you can call your
own, passes me&mdash;it does.'</p>

<p>A smile flitted over Sarah's face as she thought
how far out Naomi was in her judgment; but it
passed speedily as she saw a huge tongue of flame
dart up and blaze high above the trees.</p>

<p>'It's the garage! The petrol has taken fire!' said
Naomi. 'Whatever could they have been thinking of
to leave it there? Surely they've never left those
beautiful cars to burn themselves up?'</p>

<p>'They don't seem to have done anything to stop
the fire. If Uncle Howroyd hadn't been there himself,
and if they had not been his hands, I should have
said they had helped it, like the men the other day,'
remarked Sarah.</p>

<p>'No fear of that. Mr William's men will stand by
him and do what he says, for his sake. It's not been
their fault that Barmoral's burnt to the ground, I'll
lay,' declared Naomi with vehemence.</p>

<p>'No, I'm sure of that,' said Sarah, who felt a pang
which surprised her at the words, 'Barmoral's burnt
to the ground.' Not that they were quite true, for
Balmoral was still burning furiously; but they soon
would be.</p>

<p>Suddenly Naomi made a terrible suggestion. 'Miss
Sarah, suppose anybody is in the house?' she cried.</p>

<p>Sarah turned on her quite angrily. 'Who should
there be in the house? Of course there's no one in
it. The fire began at the top, and it's not likely any
one would stay up there to be burnt,' she cried, for
this thought had never struck her; she had taken it
for granted that the servants would have escaped at
once. After the first fright she added more calmly,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
'Of course they are safe. Balmoral is only three
stories high, and the top story is only attics and storerooms
and servants' bedrooms, and they are not likely
to be up there at this time of the day. But, pray,
don't go suggesting horrors of that kind to mother, or
you will make her quite ill.'</p>

<p>'I'm sorry if I upset you, and I know you've a
feeling heart, though you don't care about the house
burning, so I'll say no more and hope for the best,'
said Naomi.</p>

<p>Sarah felt as if she could shake her for her determined
pessimism. However, she said nothing, but
stood and watched the flames in silence till they
seemed to be dying down a little, and then she reluctantly
turned from the absorbing sight, and went
downstairs to give her mother the news.</p>

<p>'I think they've got the flames under, mother,' she
said; but Mrs Clay took little notice. 'Mother, don't
you hear? They've got the flames under at last.'</p>

<p>'Yes, my dear, I 'ear, an' I'm glad of it; but it's
your father I'm thinkin' about. I do 'ope an' pray
'e's safe,' she replied.</p>

<p>'Why shouldn't he be? The mills are all right,' said
Sarah.</p>

<p>'Yes; but I don't know if 'e's there. I keep ringin'
'im up, an' there's no answer, so 'e's not in the mills,
for they always call 'im for the telephone.'</p>

<p>'The old hands would; but, you see, everything is
different now. Let me try,' observed Sarah, taking
up the receiver, and ringing, at intervals, for some
minutes. 'They are all looking at the fire from the
lookout,' she remarked at length, as she put the
receiver down.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
Mrs Clay shook her head. 'It isn't like your
father to stand an' watch 'is property burn; 'e'll be
up an' doin' somew'ere,' she declared.</p>

<p>'Would you like me to go and see if he is still
there?' suggested Sarah. Not that she supposed for
a minute that her mother would allow her to go, for
she objected to her walking through Ousebank on
ordinary occasions when the mill-hands were out, so
she was still less likely to let her go to-day when the
town was in a state of excitement never known
before, and, to crown all, their mills in a state of
siege and their family so unpopular.</p>

<p>But Sarah was mistaken. Her mother said gratefully,
'If you would just run to the mills, dear, I
should be very glad. Even if they won't let you
through, they'll tell you, or some one will tell you, if
your father 'as come out.'</p>

<p>Sarah was just starting for her room to fetch her
hat, when she remembered that she had no hat. She
had come down with a shawl over her head like the
mill-lasses, for whom she hoped to be mistaken; and
Naomi had not thought of bringing one with the
other necessaries which she had made into a bundle.</p>

<p>'And I don't suppose you've got a hat to your
name now, Miss Sarah,' the maid observed gloomily
when consulted on the subject.</p>

<p>Sarah gave her hair a brush, and remarked lightly,
'Well I must go bareheaded. Perhaps it will please
those people to see the state of poverty they have
reduced me to.' And off she started, regardless of
Naomi's protests and offers to go and get a hat somewhere.</p>

<p>'Eh, but she's a proud lass, is yon!' said more than
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
one whom she passed, her head high and her eyes
looking straight ahead of her, not seeing or noticing
the groups through which she passed.</p>

<p>'Ay, she counts us the dust under her feet,' said
another, and the group agreed; while one of the
number observed, 'Perhaps she'll think differently
when she sees her property laid in the dust;' and a
younger man laughed, though the others said, 'Nay,
'tis nought to laugh at. Clays are no friends of
mine; but I was always agin that. 'Tis a wicked
deed they've done up at Balmoral, and tricks with
air-ships isn't a Yorkshire way of fighting, though
'tis a dirty trick he've played us with his foreigners.'</p>

<p>But Sarah had not the satisfaction of hearing any
of the remarks disapproving of the fire, and her
heart swelled as she thought that all Ousebank was
glad of their loss; for no one&mdash;not even an acquaintance,
herself the wife of a mill-owner&mdash;stopped her
to condole with her. Sarah had no idea that it was her
own repellent bearing that prevented them, nor that
this same lady went home and said to her family, with
tears in her eyes, 'It made my heart ache to see her
walking alone through all those crowds, with her
head bare and face so grave. I'd have been glad to
take her hands and say how sorry I was; but she
wouldn't look at me, but passed me as if I was
quite beneath her. I didn't dare to stop her.'</p>

<p>Nor, apparently, did the pickets dare&mdash;or care&mdash;to
do so either, as Sarah came straight up to the chief
gate and knocked at it.</p>

<p>A cautious face appeared at the other side of a
little window, and a moment afterwards the little
postern-gate was opened wide enough to let her slip
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
in, and speedily shut to with a clang by two men who
were posted there in case any one should attempt to
enter with her.</p>

<p>'Thank you. Will you take me to my father?' she
said to the men, whom she recognised as old hands.</p>

<p>'He's in the dye-house, miss. They 're making a
beautiful new colour, and the master's rare and
pleased about it,' replied the elder man.</p>

<p>'But the fire? Doesn't he mind about the fire?'
inquired the girl.</p>

<p>The man looked at her, not understanding. The
fire's all right, miss; they made it a bit too hot this
morning, but it's all right now. We've got proper
stokers and all,' he assured her, evidently thinking
she was afraid the engine was not being properly
attended to, and alluded to that.</p>

<p>It flashed across Sarah that they did not know of
the fire at Balmoral. Then her father did not know,
and she would have to tell him! She went very
slowly towards the dye-house. This possibility had
never struck her. Even though they could not see
Balmoral from Clay's Mills, there was the telephone,
and the pickets outside; but then Sarah remembered
that for some reason or other the telephone had been
abandoned, and naturally the pickets would not for
obvious reasons choose to give the news.</p>

<p>She found her father and George in the dye-room
as she had been told, the former jubilant over the
new shade, and George standing by apparently as
interested as his father.</p>

<p>'What! Sally? There's a brave girl to come and
see the prisoners! But it's an ill wind that blows no
one any good. Here's George showing himself quite
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
a business man, with the makings of a fine wool-merchant
in him, and I never knew it. So that's
all the strike has done&mdash;got them two Clays to fight
instead of one,' cried Mr Clay, and Sarah was struck
by her father's pride in George.</p>

<p>She did not answer, but stood looking appealingly
at her brother.</p>

<p>Mr Clay misunderstood her, and said, 'You don't
like the idea of a merchant-brother; but you'll have
to get used to it. I don't mean to let him go back
to college. He knows a lot of useful stuff, and these
are ticklish times.'</p>

<p>George understood his sister better, and, answering
her look, said, 'What's the matter, Sarah? Is
mother ill?'</p>

<p>Mr Clay looked anxiously at her. In his egotism
he had not thought of his timid little wife, whom all
this might well have made ill; but that he was not
devoid of regard for her Sarah saw by his face.</p>

<p>'No, it's not mother; it's Balmoral.&mdash;Father, I
thought you knew,' she stammered.</p>

<p>'Knew what? Speak out, girl. What's happened
there. Nothing short of an earthquake could harm
it; it's well enough protected.'</p>

<p>'It's burning, father,' Sarah blurted out.</p>

<p>The mill-owner looked at her unbelievingly, and
laughed his boisterous laugh. 'Burning! Nonsense!
They couldn't get near it to damage it. Why, there's
fifty police up there guarding it, and a pretty penny
it's costing me&mdash;a pretty penny all this.'</p>

<p>Sarah looked pitifully at her father. 'They dropped
fire from an air-ship, father; but Uncle Howroyd
and all his hands have gone up there to try to put
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
it out,' she hastened to add, for her father's face
terrified her.</p>

<p>He took no more notice of her; but turning to
George, on whom he seemed all of a sudden to rely,
he said,' What does the girl mean with her cock-and-bull
story of an air-ship setting my house on fire?
Why should an air-ship'&mdash;&mdash;He paused. 'How
could they get an air-ship?' he continued.</p>

<p>'Perhaps I'd better go to the lookout, father,' said
George.&mdash;Come, Sarah;' and he took his sister by the
hand and hastened along the dye-yard towards the
spiral staircase to the lookout.</p>

<p>The mill-owner let them go without a word, not
attempting to follow them, for it was an arduous
climb to the lookout, and the mill-owner was a stout
and heavy-built man, and had not been up there for
years. He stood for a little as if puzzled, then went
to the entrance-yard to the porter, and asked, 'Have
you seen or heard aught of any fire at Balmoral?'</p>

<p>'No, sir; not except what Miss Clay said,' he
replied.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Sarah was breathlessly hastening up the
stairs, and telling George all that had happened.</p>

<p>'Why didn't you tell us before?' he demanded.</p>

<p>'Because we never imagined you didn't know. I
thought every one in the town knew, and mother did
try to telephone to you, but she couldn't make any
one hear,' explained Sarah.</p>

<p>George groaned, but made no more reproaches, and
soon they came out on the lookout.</p>

<p>The flames were still raging, though not so high.
Evidently the petrol had burnt out; but not so the
fire, alas!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
'It will burn to the ground,' George remarked, as
he stood there with glasses to his eyes. 'They are
trying to save the west wing, but I doubt if
they will.'</p>

<p>'Oh George, let me look! I never thought of using
glasses! Why, you can see the people running about
with buckets!' cried Sarah.</p>

<p>'It feels like a bit of myself gone; but you don't
care, of course,' he remarked, as he reluctantly tore
himself away to go down and tell his father.</p>

<p>'I do care. And, oh George, I'm awfully sorry
for father! What will he do or say?' cried his
sister.</p>

<p>'I don't know. But how did mother take it?' he
asked.</p>

<p>'She said it was God's will. Somehow, I don't
think it surprised her; she seemed to expect a
disaster as soon as she knew about these foreigners
being brought in, and I don't think she'll care if only
father is safe,' said Sarah.</p>

<p>'Poor mother; she doesn't think of herself at all.
Still, I know the place is heavily insured. Father is
too cautious a man not to see to that, though he'll
never get those pictures or their value back again,
nor his plate. I must try to break it to him; but
it isn't a thing one can break,' said George.</p>

<p>'Well, boy, what's this story? Any truth in it?
More trees burnt?' asked Mr Clay.</p>

<p>'They've done worse this time, father; they have
managed to set fire to the house. But Uncle Howroyd
is working for all he's worth, and so are his
men, so let us hope they'll save the valuables,' said
George.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
He spoke so calmly and collectedly that his father
failed to grasp the extent of the calamity.</p>

<p>'I don't rightly understand. Is it the house that's
on fire, and which part?' he demanded. Evidently
he only imagined that it was some small outbreak
which would soon be got under.</p>

<p>George hesitated. 'It's got a good hold of the
house, sir&mdash;the fire, I mean; but we can build it up
again.'</p>

<p>'Build it up again? Build up Balmoral again?
You don't know what you're talking about. There's
a million sunk in that house,' he cried angrily, and yet
he did not believe them till he saw George's pitying
look.</p>

<p>'It's not really bad, my lad?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Yes, father, it's pretty bad; but the house is
insured.'</p>

<p>The millionaire gave a yell of rage. 'If they've
done it, by heaven they shall pay for it!' And he
made a dash for the front entrance.</p>

<hr class="para" />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></h3>

<h5>'A BAD BUSINESS.'</h5>

<p>After a moment of consternation, Sarah and
her brother followed their father, and arrived
at the front gate in time to see him dash out
and down the street before the pickets on duty at the
gate had seen what was happening, or had time to
prevent his escape, if, indeed, they had wished to do
so. Perhaps they felt that to prevent a man from
going to rescue his property from destruction would be
exceeding their duty, or perhaps they thought they
had gone far enough, for they made no attempt to stop
him, and looked after him with not unfriendly faces.</p>

<p>'He may run, but he'll not run so fast as the
flames,' said one to the others.</p>

<p>'And you're a set of blackguards for what you've
done, and I'd sooner be a blackleg any day than a
blackguard,' shouted the watch inside the gate to the
watch outside.</p>

<p>'I'd nought to do with it, Ben; I'm only obeying
orders standing here, and there's no denying that the
master's driven the lads to it. They've hot blood,
and he's roused it,' replied the picket, who did not
seem to resent the plain speaking of his former mate.</p>

<p>'No one is ever driven to setting other folk's homes
on fire,' said the watchman bluntly.</p>

<p>'George, what do you think he's going to do?'
demanded Sarah of her brother, who was standing,
cigarette in mouth, listening with apparent indifference
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
to the colloquy of the past and present
hands.</p>

<p>'Gone to see what they are doing at Balmoral,'
observed George.</p>

<p>'Hadn't you better go after him?' suggested his
sister.</p>

<p>'I don't think so. Strikes me I'd better keep a
lookout for possible air-ships dropping down upon us
here. They'll get a warm reception if they do,' said
George with significance.</p>

<p>'I wonder where they got the air-ships from.
Naomi says it's the London agitators who have done
it all,' said Sarah.</p>

<p>'Very likely. Well, it's a miserable business. I
don't care for the men we've got here overmuch,
though they do their work very well, and it was very
clever of the governor to have got them here and at
work so promptly,' said George.</p>

<p>'A good deal too clever! And see what the result
has been! He tricked the hands, and the hands have
tricked him, and he has come worst off so far,' retorted
Sarah.</p>

<p>'I don't know about that! There's a proverb which
says, "He laughs longest who laughs last," and we've
yet to see who that will be. So far, the men have
burnt Balmoral, but that loss is insured against; but
they have not bettered their position, and they are
losing money, whereas the governor is making money
by the change.'</p>

<p>'One would think it was you who didn't care now;
you stand there smoking, as if nothing were the
matter,' remarked Sarah.</p>

<p>'If you will tell me what good I should do by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
getting excited I might try it; but I don't know of
anything to be gained by making a row. You'd
better go back to mother, and tell her the mills are all
right, that father's gone to see what he can do at
Balmoral, and that I shall stop here until further
notice. Try to put a good face on it, and cheer her
up, Sarah. She isn't fit for all this worry,' urged her
brother.</p>

<p>'I'll do my best,' replied Sarah; and she went back
to her mother, and left her brother in charge of the
mills and of the men.</p>

<p>The two porters at the gate were his devoted
servants, and talked to him with the freedom of old
workmen, as they deplored the present condition of
things. 'And the sooner we see the backs of those
chaps the better,' said one. 'They are quick enough,
but they're not thorough; and they'd chuck it up
to-morrow if it weren't for the high wages they're
bribed with.'</p>

<p>'I shouldn't have thought that would pay,' observed
George in his usual lazy, indifferent way.</p>

<p>The man gave him a look, and said in a significant
tone, 'It doesn't&mdash;at least, it wouldn't in the long-run;
but it pays better than letting the mills "play," especially
with this big contract on for blankets for abroad.
The hands knew that, and that's why they struck.
They thought the master'd have been obliged to
give way to get it done. And so did I, and so he
would have if he hadn't got those chaps by a miracle.'</p>

<p>'How did he get them?' inquired George, asking
the same question that every one else was asking.</p>

<p>The man laughed, with an evident appreciation of
the smartness that could accomplish what looked like
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
a miracle, although he shook his head disapprovingly.
'He telephoned to somewhere abroad&mdash;I don't rightly
know if 'twas France or Belgium; in fact, he've been
'phoning for days; and it seems there was a wool-mill
shut down, and these men out of employ, and he had
the whole lot brought over and put in here by midnight
on Sunday. They came in wagon-loads from a
station ten miles off, and not a soul knew. Oh, he
managed it well, did the master! But they laugh
best who laugh last, as the saying is.'</p>

<p>George took a whiff of his cigarette. 'So you
think the men will laugh the last? Do you think
they'll burn the mills down?' he inquired.</p>

<p>'No, sir; I don't think they could if they would,
and I doubt if they would. 'Twould be wholesale
murder, with all those hands inside. Besides, there'll
be some arrests for this other job, and that'll cool
their blood. No; what I'm afraid of is those men
in here,' said the old man, pointing with his thumb
over his shoulder towards the mill-buildings.</p>

<p>'What do you think they'll do?' George demanded.</p>

<p>'They'll go. They're getting tired of the confinement
and the dullness. Besides, they are frightened.
Goodness knows how they've got to know anything
of what's going on outside, but they have; and if
they hear of this fire it'll be all up with us. They'll
go, and a sack of gold won't keep them.'</p>

<p>George looked very thoughtful. 'Where do they
sleep, and what do they eat?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Oh, they sleep on blankets and wool in the barns.
And they've got their own cooks, and there's plenty
of food of the kind they like,' replied the man, with
true British contempt for foreign messes.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
'What food have they, and how did you get enough
in for them?' George asked.</p>

<p>'That's the master again! There's sacks and
sacks of flour and coffee and beans, and things that
we thought were bales of wool, and tins of milk; and
they eat a lot of them things, and very little meat,
except bacon. But they're crying out for vegetables.
Mark my words, Mr George, they won't be here
much longer, double pay or not.'</p>

<p>George turned and left him, and went for a walk
through the mills. The men greeted him rather
surlily, from which he opined that they could not be
French, though they spoke that language; but when
he put any questions they declined to answer, saying
that their orders were not to give any information to
any one. However, they seemed to be working well,
and so George remarked to their manager.</p>

<p>'Yes, sir; they are doing time-work. They will get
a bonus each if the work they are doing is finished
by a certain time,' replied the man.</p>

<p>'I see,' said George, and then he looked thoughtful
again. They would finish the contract and go. He
walked back to the office, from whence he meant to
go to the lookout again to see how the fire was going,
but was in time to hear the ring of the telephone.
'Halloa!' he said.</p>

<p>'It's Sarah! Do you see what's happened at
Balmoral?' she inquired.</p>

<p>'No; but I imagine it's burning or burnt to the
ground,' said George in a resigned tone.</p>

<p>'The fire's out; at least, there's only smoke to be
seen. But everybody's come away, and I am afraid
some one is hurt, for I saw through the glasses that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
they were crowding round something, and then the
men made a stretcher, and they are bringing whoever
it is to Ousebank,' said Sarah.</p>

<p>'God forbid that any life has been lost! Let me
know what it is as soon as you know. I can't leave
the mills till father comes back, and I don't know
that I shall even then. I think I'm wanted here.'</p>

<p>'I wish I could be there with you!' exclaimed Sarah.</p>

<p>'You've got to stay where you are and look after
mother. How is she?' inquired George.</p>

<p>'She's all right. At least, she sits quite quietly,
and says it's God's will, and that she doesn't care
as long as she has all of us. But it's very dull
here. Women always do have the dull work to do
in this world,' observed Sarah.</p>

<p>'They think they have; but I don't think you'd
be much better off here; it's not particularly lively
being with a lot of sulky foreigners who won't talk
to you.'</p>

<p>'How can they if they're foreigners?' protested
Sarah.</p>

<p>'They can talk French all right, some of them; but
they won't answer me in their own language,' said
George.</p>

<p>'I dare say they don't understand your French,'
said Sarah.</p>

<p>But George declined to notice this insulting
remark. Sarah was evidently called away from
the telephone, and ring as he might he could get
no answer from her or any one at Howroyd's.
He tried to get on to the office, but was told that
Howroyd's was 'playing,' as they say in the north
country, because the most of the men were at Balmoral.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
So there was nothing for it but to possess his
soul in patience, and watch the men at their dinner-hour
eating bacon and haricot beans, and a kind of
soup made out of George could not imagine what,
seeing that the cooks had no vegetables to make it
with, and drinking wine and water.</p>

<p>'They seem to enjoy their food,' George remarked
to Ben the gate-keeper.</p>

<p>'Yes, sir, they do; and a little seems to go a long
way with them. But listen to them now that their
tongues are loosened! Goodness only knows what
they are saying, but they seem excited enough. I'd
give a good deal to understand their jargon,' replied
Ben.</p>

<p>'It's Flemish, I fancy. Anyway, I can't understand
it. I wish I had some one to send to Howroyd's. I
suppose it wouldn't be safe for one of you to leave
the gate?' said George.</p>

<p>'Safe or not, I daren't risk it. The master's orders
were not to leave it without his permission, if I
wanted to stay with him. But I shouldn't worry, sir;
ill news travels apace, and if there were anything
wrong you'd have heard it soon enough,' said the man.</p>

<p>He had scarcely uttered these words when their
attention was attracted by a knocking at the entrance-gate;
and upon Ben going to the window to look out,
he saw the picket on duty making signs to him
to come to the gate and speak. The man looked
so disturbed, and almost ashamed, that Ben knew
there was nothing to fear from him except bad news,
and that he felt pretty sure he should soon hear.</p>

<p>'Now, what villainy have you been up to?' he asked,
as he opened the gate half-way.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
'It's no use making bad blood by hard words, Ben.
I told you before I've had nought to do with the
happenings at Balmoral. We're only fighting for our
rights and our livelihood, that you're trying to take
away from us; but there, I didn't come to say all that,
but to see the young master, if he'll let me have a
word with him,' said the man.</p>

<p>'I shouldn't think he'd have anything to say to
you, and I shouldn't have thought you'd the face to
speak to him when you're trying to ruin him; and
as for me taking your livelihood away, you've done
it yourselves. Dogs in the manger, I call you; won't
work yourselves, and won't let any one else.'</p>

<p>'Have done, Ben, and let me see Mr George. I've
got a message that won't wait,' said the other.</p>

<p>The gate-keeper went to find George, who was again
at the telephone in a vain effort to communicate with
his sister, with whom he felt very irritated for leaving
him without news for so long.</p>

<p>'Wants to see me? One of the pickets, you say?
Does he want to come to terms, do you think?' inquired
George.</p>

<p>'I doubt it, sir; but you'd better see him. He says
his message won't wait.'</p>

<p>Thus entreated, George left the telephone and went
to the gate.</p>

<p>'Excuse me, Mr George,' said the man, standing
bareheaded to speak to him, which even George
knew was a token of great respect&mdash;was it also sympathy?&mdash;coming
from a mill-hand of his father's.
'Excuse me, but we think you're wanted at Howroyd's.
There's been an accident'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'An accident? To whom?' interrupted George.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
'To the&mdash;to Mr Clay, sir,' said the man.</p>

<p>George was just hurrying off, but stopped for a
moment. Suppose this were a ruse to get him out of
the mills. He half-thought of trying to get a message
to Sarah before leaving the mills.</p>

<p>But the man, seeming to guess his thoughts, said,
'We sha'n't interfere with the mills, sir, if you'll take
my word for it.'</p>

<p>'You can scarcely expect me to feel very secure,
can you?' said George quietly.</p>

<p>'No, sir, I know; but I swear to you I'll fetch you
if you're wanted here. But do you go to Howroyd's
at once,' said the man so earnestly that George hesitated
no longer. Touching his hat as he passed them,
he walked rapidly to his uncle's, where he found all
in confusion.</p>

<p>The first person he saw was Sarah. 'What is the
matter with father?' he asked.</p>

<p>'I don't know,' said Sarah.</p>

<p>'Don't know! Where is he?' asked George.</p>

<p>'In the sitting-room; that's why I couldn't get at
the telephone. They disconnected it to stop the noise.
The doctors are with him,' replied Sarah, who looked
white and shaken.</p>

<p>'How did it happen? Did he get burnt? Is
there no one to tell me anything?' asked George
in despair.</p>

<p>'I don't know. He was brought on a stretcher,
and Uncle Howroyd came with him, and he and
mother have gone into that room. I don't know any
more than you; but, oh, I am glad you've come!'
cried Sarah, bursting into tears.</p>

<p>'Come and sit down,' said George, putting his arm
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
round his sister's shoulder. 'Some one will come out
in a minute, I hope.'</p>

<p>It was William Howroyd who came. 'You here,
my lad! That's right. You'll have to take the head
of affairs now,' he said kindly but sadly.</p>

<p>'Is my father&mdash;dead?' asked George, with pale lips.</p>

<p>'No, no, not dead; but it's a stroke, and he won't
be fit for business for some time. If I can help you
I will; but it's a bad business, a very bad business.
Well, my home is yours, as you know, and you must
all stay here for the present. As for the future, why,
you can stay here then if you will. It's not a mansion,
but there's room enough for us all.'</p>

<h5>TRUE YORKSHIRE GRIT.</h5>

<p>'Can I see my father, sir?' said George.</p>

<p>'Yes, of course, my lad. Go in. He won't
know you, but you may go in,' said his uncle.</p>

<p>Mrs Clay sat watching beside her husband, who lay
on his improvised couch in the sitting-room, and she
looked up dully when her son came in. 'They've
killed 'im this time, George,' she said.</p>

<p>'I hope not, mother. He'll pull through this,'
replied her son.</p>

<p>But his mother shook her head. ''E'll never get
over bein' bested by the men. 'E's always been so
masterful all 'is life, an' they've mastered 'im at last,'
she declared.</p>

<p>'I don't know so much about that. Father said I
was to stop at home and help him, and I mean to do
it, and see if things can't be straightened out again,'
said George, with youthful confidence.</p>

<p>Mrs Clay looked at her son proudly. 'You've
the same spirit as your father, though you've never
shown it before; but this coil's too 'ard for you to
untwist, lad. You'd best leave it to your uncle Bill;
'e'll do the best 'e can for us all, an' there'll always
be a bite an' a sup for us while 'e lives. But Clay's
Mills are a thing of the past now, lad.'</p>

<p>Sarah, who, without asking leave of any one, had
followed her brother into the sick-room, broke in
now. 'We're not going to live on charity, mother.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
If we really are poor I shall just work in a mill, that's
all. I won't live on any one else, not even Uncle
Howroyd.'</p>

<p>Her mother and brother both gave her a warning
glance.</p>

<p>George said in low tones, 'It's no good exaggerating
the misfortune. We have met with losses, and my
father may not be a millionaire at this moment; but
I hope we may not long trespass on Uncle Howroyd's
hospitality, though there is no talk of living
on charity.'</p>

<p>As he said this his father opened his eyes, and it
seemed to George that there was a gleam of consciousness
in them. He bent over the sick man, and
said in low, clear tones, 'Father, I'll do my best to
keep the mills going. That is your wish, is it not?'</p>

<p>''E can't 'ear, George,' sighed his mother.</p>

<p>'I think he understood,' declared George; and
though the others did not agree with him, they said
no more to discourage the young man.</p>

<p>'Come, Sarah,' George said gently to his sister, as he
drew her out of the room with him, 'you'll have to
help me to put all this business right.'</p>

<p>'I? What can I do? I know nothing about
accounts, you know,' cried Sarah, secretly pleased, all
the same, at the idea of being of use.</p>

<p>'You are often down at Uncle Howroyd's, and I
hear you talking of "fettles and pieces," and goodness
knows what all,' observed George.</p>

<p>Sarah laughed. 'I suppose you mean fettlers
(people who clean the machines) and piecers (those
who join the pieces of wool or yarn together when it
breaks),' she explained.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
'There! You see I don't even know these words,
and if I have to go into accounts and details I must
know them, or I shall be showing my ignorance, and
the people will have no confidence in me,' returned
George.</p>

<p>'But those foreigners don't understand you. What
will you do with them?' inquired Sarah.</p>

<p>'Nothing. I shall send them off the minute this
contract is done,' said George. 'That is to say, if
Uncle Howroyd approves.'</p>

<p>'What are you going to do with my approval, my
lad?' demanded William Howroyd, coming in and
putting his hand for a moment kindly on his nephew's
shoulder.</p>

<p>Sarah was struck by his serious and troubled face.
She wondered whether it was anxiety for his brother's
health or sorrow for the misdeeds of the Ousebank
men. She did not know that there was a third reason
added to these two; but she soon was to know it.</p>

<p>'I want to pack off those men as soon as the contract
we have in hand is finished,' said George.</p>

<p>'They've saved you and me any trouble, George,
lad. They've discharged themselves,' said Mr Howroyd
gravely.</p>

<p>George looked at his uncle aghast. 'You mean
that the foreigners have gone&mdash;without a minute's
warning?' he asked.</p>

<p>'They have that,' replied Mr Howroyd.</p>

<p>'But why did they suddenly do that? They
seemed to go back to work willingly enough after
their dinner,' said George.</p>

<p>'It seems they had some means of communicating
with the outside world. When they heard of your
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
poor father's illness, and were told he was ruined, and
his house even burnt down, they decided to leave a
sinking ship,' said Mr Howroyd.</p>

<p>'Uncle Howroyd, do you think it is a sinking ship?'
inquired Sarah.</p>

<p>Mr Howroyd considered a little; but, being a man
who thought honesty always the best policy, he
replied frankly, 'I think we shall save enough out of
the wreck to keep you afloat; but I think Clay's Mills
must shut.'</p>

<p>'I don't understand that, sir. Of course, I know
that we must have lost a good deal by the fire, and
this contract, too, will be a serious loss; but there is
the insurance of the house, and I understand that,
thanks to you and other kind helpers, a good deal
was saved at Balmoral,' observed George.</p>

<p>'That is so, my lad; but the trouble is&mdash;and that's
what caused your father's illness&mdash;the house was not
insured,' said Mr Howroyd.</p>

<p>'Oh, but, uncle, it was. I happen to know, because
father said the insurance he paid would keep a family
comfortably,' interrupted Sarah.</p>

<p>'I know, and so I thought; but, owing to threats
they received, saying it was going to be burnt down,
the company asked such a heavy premium that your
father refused to pay it, and said he'd take precautions
instead. It was a mad thing, and no one
but him would have dared to do it. And now,
what are you going to do with an empty mill,
whose hands have all struck, and whose head is lying
unconscious?' inquired Mr Howroyd kindly but discouragingly.</p>

<p>The brother and sister had drawn closer to each
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
other instinctively in this their first trouble, for
trouble it was to both.</p>

<p>'If we give up the mills, what have we to live on?
I don't know my father's affairs, but I imagine he
has a large capital,' said George.</p>

<p>'It's difficult to explain to you, but most of it was
in the mills. I expect that you will have a few
hundreds a year when the business is wound up. But
things have not been so prosperous as they have
appeared of late with your father, and he spent
freely,' replied Mr Howroyd.</p>

<p>George sat silent after this; but Sarah suddenly
exclaimed, 'George, don't give it up! Open the mills
again, and try to keep them going with the old hands.
I know you could, with Uncle Howroyd's help, and
I'll stop at home and help you all I can, and take
care of mother.'</p>

<p>George gave his sister a swift glance, and then
appealed to his uncle. 'What do you say, sir? Is it
any use my trying?'</p>

<p>'My lad,' said Mr Howroyd in a moved tone of voice,
'if you had asked me that question a month ago I
should have told you to go back to your Greek and
your Latin at college, and leave blanket-making to
those who know what they are doing; but if you like
to try, I'll not be the one to stop you. It won't be
much worse if you fail.'</p>

<p>'Oh, but he won't fail.&mdash;Will you, George?' cried
Sarah.</p>

<p>'I hope not; I can but try,' said George.</p>

<p>But the two enthusiasts had a sudden check when
they informed their mother.</p>

<p>'George run the mills! You don't know w'at you
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
are talkin' about.&mdash;That's your doin', Sarah; you've
always some maggot in your 'ead.'</p>

<p>'But Uncle Howroyd said he might try,' said Sarah.</p>

<p>'Your uncle Howroyd's kindness itself, an' generous
to a fault. Don't you see you'd be runnin' them
on 'is credit? Who'd trust George if they thought 'e
was responsible? An' if your uncle Howroyd stan's
surety 'e runs to lose 'eavily,' said Mrs Clay, who
knew something about business.</p>

<p>'I never thought of that,' said Sarah slowly.</p>

<p>'Mother, you know that a certain sum was settled
on me when I came of age, and was not invested in
the business,' said her son.</p>

<p>'Yes, dear; but don't you touch that. You'll only
lose it, an' then w'ere will you be?' she protested.</p>

<p>'Where I am now, under the necessity of earning
my own living, and that will be no hardship,' said
George, with his pleasant smile.</p>

<p>But their mother was not to be persuaded. 'Your
father was a wonderful man. You 'aven't 'is talents,
though you're dear, good children,' was all she would
say.</p>

<p>'My father's talents didn't prevent him from
making a horrid mess of things,' began Sarah hotly.</p>

<p>But George silenced his sister, and said to his
mother, 'Very well, dear mother, if you do not wish
me to try to carry on father's business for him till
he is able to take it up again himself, then I will not
do so; but I shall ask Uncle Howroyd to take me
into his mill to learn the business of a blanket-maker.
I mean to be sooner or later.'</p>

<p>Mrs Clay looked at her son in amazement. 'You,
George! But all your book-learnin'&mdash;w'at are you
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
goin' to do wi' all that? Is it all goin' to be
wasted? All your beautiful, expensive education an'
all?' she expostulated. 'An' Sarah, too, talkin' o'
stayin' at 'ome an' 'elpin'! She'll 'ave to go to some
school, though I doubt whether we can afford her
present one.'</p>

<p>'I don't think that school is much loss to Sarah,
though it seems to have suited Miss Cunningham.
But as for my book-learning, I mean to try to apply
it to manufacturing; and if it is not much use there,
as I fear it won't be, still no knowledge is lost, and I
shall always have my books and the pleasure of reading,'
remarked George.</p>

<p>'Well, my dear, you must do as you think best.
If you could do such a thing as keep the mills goin'
till your father was about again, 'twould be a grand
thing, an' give 'im new life w'en 'e came to 'imself,
an' I've no right to be a 'indrance in your way; so
do as you wish, dear, an' God bless you for a dear,
good boy!' said his mother, after some argument.</p>

<p>'Come along Sarah, let's go and look at our mills.
It's rather disgraceful, but, do you know, I've never
been over the whole of them before,' said George.</p>

<p>'It will be dreadful to see them empty and "playing,"
as the people say,' said Sarah.</p>

<p>'Please, sir,' said Naomi, 'the French <i>chef</i> is here,
and wants a month's wages and compensation for loss,
he says.'</p>

<p>George paused on the threshold. 'I thought Sykes
was seeing to all that, and housing the people till we
could settle with them?' said George.</p>

<p>'He says he wishes to leave this country of savages
at once,' said Naomi, with a toss of her head.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
'I expect there's money in the till at the mills,' said
Sarah.</p>

<p>'I'll write him a cheque on my own bank, and I
shall be thankful to eat no more of his elaborate
messes,' observed George; and he did so, though the
cheque was a much bigger one than he had expected,
and the operation had to be repeated till most of the
servants were satisfied, after which George said, with
a laugh, to his sister, 'I hope Sykes and Naomi and
Tom Fox won't present their bills, for, to tell the
truth, I've used up all my balance, and rather more.'</p>

<p>'Have you paid every one else?' asked Sarah.</p>

<p>'Yes; and I had no idea we had such an army to
wait upon us. You've no idea what the total comes
to,' said George, as he ruefully totalled it up.</p>

<p>'There must be lots of money somewhere,' said
Sarah vaguely.</p>

<p>'Ah, now you begin to understand what poverty
means,' said George. 'It's not quite so lovely, is it,
after all?'</p>

<p>Sarah did not choose to answer this taunt, and
was saved from the necessity of doing so by the
announcement that Tom Fox and Sykes the butler
were outside.</p>

<p>'I shall have to overdraw and realise some money,'
observed George to his sister, after he had told Naomi
to show them in.</p>

<p>'And please, sir, they speak for me, if you'll excuse
me,' said Naomi as she ushered them into the room.</p>

<p>Sarah was surprised to find how disappointed and
hurt she felt at this cupidity on the part of Naomi,
and she would not look at her at all.</p>

<p>'Ah, Sykes, you want your wages? How much
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
will that be?' said George, quiet and pleasant as
usual.</p>

<p>'No, no, Mr George, I didn't come for them, sir. If
you'll excuse me, sir, and not think it a liberty, but
I've a nice house, a biggish house, though 'tis a
cottage compared to Balmoral of course; but it's
lying empty, and it would be convenient to have it
used, and I'm going there myself to-night, and if
you'd condescend for the next few months'&mdash;&mdash;said
Sykes, with much clearing of his throat and apologetic
coughs.</p>

<p>'That's exceedingly kind of you, Sykes,' cried
George, much touched. 'Where is this house?'</p>

<p>'Right opposite Balmoral, on the hill, Mr George.
It touches the grounds, and what I was thinking was,
you could make a gate into the grounds, and you'd
be like in your own park, same as before.'</p>

<p>'I know the house. It's a big one, as you say.
You've made money, then, Sykes?'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir; the master was always liberal, and I've
saved, and done well in investments. I'd be pleased
to wait on you, same as before.  And Tom Fox
here&mdash;&mdash; Why don't you speak up, Tom?' urged
Sykes.</p>

<p>'I'd be glad to remain in your service, Mr George,
and motor you down to town, as I hear you are
taking on the business. I saved the motors, all on
'em,' said Tom.</p>

<p>'I don't know how to thank you, my friends, except
by accepting your offers with all my heart; and if
the mills pay all right you must take shares,' said
George, with his winning smile.</p>

<p>'Well, we've got three servants and a motor, so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
far,' said Sarah; 'because, of course, Naomi is going
to stay, and it will be very nice to be still on the hill
instead of living in Ousebank. I hate Ousebank'.</p>

<p>George wanted to remind Sarah that she had
hated Balmoral; but he decided not to cast up the
past, as she was so much improved, so he only said,
'Yes, I've often looked at that Red House, and
wondered whose it was, and who would come and live
in it. I little thought that it would be ourselves.'</p>

<p>'It reminds me of the Bible,' observed Sarah
abruptly.</p>

<p>'What does?' asked George. 'The Red House?'</p>

<p>'No; all the other servants fleeing like the hireling,
but our own Yorkshire servants staying with us, and
offering their services and houses, and all.'</p>

<p>'There's another text it makes me think of,' said
George reverently, 'and that is to put your trust in
God.'</p>

<h5>SARAH IS MUCH IMPROVED.</h5>

<p>'George, I'm going to cheer mother up
by telling her what a nice house we have
had offered to us,' said Sarah, full of
the new plans.</p>

<p>'I don't fancy anything will cheer mother while
father lies there in that condition. However, she will
be glad that Sykes has shown himself loyal,' replied
George, who was just going down to the mills.</p>

<p>Mrs Clay had been sitting by her husband the
whole of the day, and no power could induce her to
leave him; but now Mr Howroyd had persuaded her
to come and take some food. The two met George
and Sarah in the passage.</p>

<p>'Going out, George? What are you living on
to-day&mdash;air or excitement? Don't you know it's
dinner-time?' he exclaimed when he saw that his
nephew had his hat in his hand and was evidently
going out.</p>

<p>'I was just going to the mills, uncle. I shall be
back in half-an-hour,' said George.</p>

<p>'What are you going to do there? They are shut
up, and Luke Mickleroyd and the other watchmen
are in charge. Come and have some food, lad; it will
help your mother to eat if she sees you eating. You
must all badly want something; you've starved all
day.'</p>

<p>George Clay put down his hat, remarking, 'I had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
no idea it was so late.&mdash;Come, mother, take my
arm.'</p>

<p>'Mother, we have something so nice to tell you,'
said Sarah, speaking in a gentler voice than was her
wont to her mother.</p>

<p>''Ave you, my dear?' said Mrs Clay indifferently.</p>

<p>'Yes; we've got a house for you to live in already.'</p>

<p>'I know, Sarah. Your uncle is very kind. I'm
sure I'm very grateful to 'im,' said Mrs Clay.</p>

<p>'Oh, but it isn't Uncle Howroyd; it's Sykes. He
wants us to live in his Red House on the top of the
hill,' cried Sarah, her face aglow with pleasure at the
good news she was imparting.</p>

<p>'Sykes, our butler! I 'aven't come to sharin' my
butler's 'ouse,' said Mrs Clay, bridling.</p>

<p>'But he's going to wait on us just as he used to do,'
explained Sarah.</p>

<p>'Wat's the good o' talkin' nonsense, Sarah?
'Ow can I order a man about in 'is own 'ouse? An'
'ow can you want your poor father to open 'is eyes
an' look upon the ruins o' 'is beautiful mansion?
It's downright indecent o' you to be so glad that
you've got to live in a poky little 'ouse; but, at least,
you sha'n't drag your father an' me to live there, to be
reminded o' the beautiful past,' said Mrs Clay.</p>

<p>'Nay, Polly, my dear, you are taking this quite
wrong. The children are behaving as well as can be,
and Sykes too; and it's not a poky house, by any
means. In fact, it's as big as this, and I don't know
that it would be a bad idea, after a little while,'
urged Mr Howroyd.</p>

<p>'I'm sure, Bill, I don't want to complain; but it's
all so strange without Mark, an' to think o' 'im
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
in Syke's 'ouse, after w'at 'e's been used to,' said his
sister-in-law.</p>

<p>Sarah restrained her first impulse to reply indignantly,
and said, 'I don't think father would mind,
and it was partly for his sake I was glad. I thought
he could still have his park and grounds, and you
forget he could not see the ruins of Balmoral, because
the plantations come between.'</p>

<p>'Besides, mother, if things go well we shall perhaps
be able to build the house again,' suggested George.
But he was no more successful than his sister in
cheering his mother.</p>

<p>She answered him, quite shortly for her, 'That
you'll never do, George. There'll never be another
Balmoral, so don't you think it. There are not many
men like Mark, an' there never was a 'ouse like 'is
now'ere, not even the King's, so I've 'eard, an' I'm
glad an' proud to 'ave lived in it; but I'll try an'
be resigned to the will o' Providence; an' if you
both wish it, an' your uncle thinks it right, I'll go to
Sykes's 'ouse w'en your father is able to be moved.'</p>

<p>Mrs Clay said 'Sykes's 'ouse' in a tone of such
contempt that her brother-in-law observed, with his
genial laugh, 'One would think it was the workhouse
by the way you talk, instead of being as big as many
a manufacturer's. But I know you are thinking of
the old place, and, of course, after what you've been
used to it is a trial; but you must pluck up courage
and be thankful that you have your family still and
no lost lives to mourn over.'</p>

<p>Mrs Clay shook her head in a melancholy way; she
was not to be comforted, and the others gave it up.</p>

<p>'One would think he had been the best and kindest
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
husband in the world, instead of being'&mdash;&mdash;began
Sarah after dinner, when her mother had hurried
back to her husband's room; but here she checked
herself.</p>

<p>'Well, there's one thing&mdash;you'll excite no envy,
hatred, and malice at the Red House; and you know
the proverb, "Better is a dinner of herbs where love
is, than a stalled ox and hatred therewith,"' said
their uncle.</p>

<p>'Oh!' cried Sarah, and then explained, 'That's just
what I said when we lived at Balmoral; but I didn't
mean it to come about in this dreadful way.'</p>

<p>'Ay; but things never do come about in the way
we want or expect,' said Mr Howroyd as he rose
from the table, leaving the brother and sister together.</p>

<p>'George, what are you thinking of?' asked his
sister abruptly, after the former had sat for some
time smoking a cigarette, and leaning back in his
old indolent way.</p>

<p>'Thinking of? I'm thinking that I've undertaken
a task too big for me, and that I should do better
to accept Uncle Howroyd's offer of winding up affairs,'
he replied.</p>

<p>'Then you are a coward! And I only wish I were
your age and a man, and I'd carry on the mills
myself, and show people.'</p>

<p>George looked at his sister with an amused smile,
which was his usual way of treating her outbursts, and
which always exasperated her; but he hastened to say,
'Steady there, Sarah! I never said I was going to
back out, only that things seem more difficult than
they did when I began.'</p>

<p>'Why? After Sykes's offer, and Tom Fox's? I never
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
told mother of him. It didn't seem to be any use,
because she doesn't care for anything or feel grateful
about anything.'</p>

<p>'I hope I shall have as good a wife; but she will be
difficult to find,' observed George.</p>

<p>'You'll probably marry a virago; easy-going people
like you generally do, and you'll be henpecked all
your life,' was Sarah's consoling remark.</p>

<p>Then they both laughed, which did them good.
Not very long after they went to bed, and, being
young and full of hope, to sleep.</p>

<p>It seemed to them both that they had just shut
their eyes when they heard the clanging of a bell;
and, starting up in alarm, they recognised it as the
bell of their uncle's mill calling the people to work.</p>

<p>George decided to go down to the mills, and a very
short time saw him dressed and at the gates.</p>

<p>''Tis young Clay,' he heard as he passed down
the street, through groups of idle men, women, and
girls, whom he guessed to be their former employ&eacute;s.
They had nothing to get up for; but habit was too
strong for them, and they had risen and turned out
at the same hour.</p>

<p>'What'll he be going to do at t' old mills?' some
of them inquired of each other.</p>

<p>'I be main sorry for him. He's a right good young
gentleman, they say,' said one woman.</p>

<p>'I wish he'd run the mills. I'd work for him,'
said another.</p>

<p>'If he'd have you; but I doubt he'd not have one
of his father's hands after what's happened,' was
the retort.</p>

<p>'He's but a youngster; he can't run the mills.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
They'll have to shut down till the old master comes
to, or this one gets old enough,' said a shrewd old
hand.</p>

<p>'Yes, 'twould never do for he to start blanket-making
without experience; he'd soon run aground.
I'd not work for him,' remarked another old man.</p>

<p>Evidently no one had any idea that George intended
to try his hand at the business, in spite of inexperience
and youth; and, indeed, as he went down the street he
found himself wondering how he was to set about it,
and whether he had not better brave Sarah's scorn
and give it up. But he reasoned with himself, 'I will
go on till my private capital is exhausted, and if I
have failed by then I'll own it and give up.' With
new resolve, he walked briskly on and entered the
silent mills.</p>

<p>The clang of the gate as it shut after him struck
painfully on his ears, and he went to the office and
sat down to think. 'If only I knew what to do!
Perhaps this room will inspire me,' he murmured.
But the room did not seem to do so; on the contrary,
he was oppressed with the sense of the failure in
which all the business done in that room had ended.</p>

<p>Suddenly the door opened, and Sarah, dainty and
fresh in the muslin Naomi had thoughtfully brought
her, almost her only possession in the way of clothes,
came in. 'George, I have an inspiration,' she said.</p>

<p>Her brother looked up with a smile. 'That's
funny,' he replied, 'for that's just what I was sitting
here waiting for.'</p>

<p>'That's a nice, useless thing to do!' said Sarah.</p>

<p>'On the contrary, it appears to have been answered,'
he said.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
'Oh, well, it wasn't your sitting there that made me
come and have that inspiration; it was the clanging
of Uncle Howroyd's bell. Why don't you do the
same thing?' inquired Sarah.</p>

<p>'Do what?' demanded George, who did not think
much of this inspiration.</p>

<p>'Ring the bell&mdash;the big bell, I mean&mdash;to call the
hands in, just as if nothing had happened,' urged
Sarah.</p>

<p>'Nothing would happen if I did, except that we
should have a gaping crowd round the gate, and the
fire-brigade coming to see if we had a fire. So, if
that's your inspiration, I'm inclined to agree with
you that my waiting for it has been useless,' returned
George.</p>

<p>'I wish you'd try, George. I believe the hands
would all come back, and we should get the contract
done after all,' persisted Sarah. 'They looked at me
in quite a friendly way as I passed, and lots of the
men touched their hats, a thing they never did
before.'</p>

<p>George hesitated. 'But I don't feel that I could
take them back again,' he said.</p>

<p>'Then what do you mean to do? You can't run
the mills with new hands,' she protested.</p>

<p>'No; but I can't take back the men who have
destroyed our property,' he declared.</p>

<p>'They are, or soon will be, taken up; so they won't
apply,' began Sarah, when her brother interrupted her.</p>

<p>'Sarah,' he cried with sudden vigour, 'you have
inspired me after all! I will have the bell rung, and
when the people come, as some are sure to come, out
of curiosity, I will make them a speech, and explain
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
that those whom my father dismissed are still dismissed,
but that the rest I shall be glad to have back. I'll
speak to the manager, and see what he thinks.'</p>

<p>The manager and Ben looked admiringly at George.</p>

<p>'There's pluck for you! Let's hope it will be
rewarded. At any rate, we can but try,' they said;
and they gave orders for the big mills-bell to be rung,
and the few faithful ones stood in the yard, making
a kind of bodyguard round George, and waited for
the curious crowd to arrive.</p>

<p>Sarah watched from the office window, and her
eyes shone with excitement as she heard the sound of
clogs and many footsteps coming down the street.
'I was right' she cried. 'It's our old hands! I
knew they'd come.'</p>

<p>And they did come, till the mill-yard was packed,
and then George made them a speech.</p>

<p>'My father is stricken down by the misdeeds of
some of his former employ&eacute;s, and in his absence I
am going, with the help of my good friends here,
to run my father's mills. Those of you who
voluntarily left his employ are welcome to return to
it; those he discharged will not be admitted.'</p>

<p>Such, in brief, was the young man's speech. The
hands noticed that he had not called them 'friends,'
nor, indeed, had his tone been friendly, but only
business-like and curt, in marked contradiction to the
way he had spoken of 'my good friends here,' alluding
to those who had remained at their posts. But
they were just men, and they respected the young
man all the more for bravely and boldly 'standing
up to them,' and showing his loyalty to his father and
those who had stood by his father.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
Some few slunk away. They were those Mr Clay
had discharged&mdash;an act which had brought about the
strike. But this time their discharge was accepted.
Without exception the hands took up their old places;
the engine, which had stopped, went on again; the
fires, which had not yet gone out, were replenished;
and before William Howroyd could get down to see
what new misfortune this was, Clay's Mills had
ceased to 'play.'</p>

<p>'Nay, my lass, you can't be serious. Men are not
a flock of sheep to come back to you just because the
bell rings,' he protested when Sarah told him the
tale.</p>

<p>'Just go into the rooms and see for yourself,'
she said. 'They are all setting to work with a will.'</p>

<p>'But I meant to have a talk with George and
try to arrange things,' objected Mr Howroyd. 'One
can't restart a business like this in this hap-hazard
manner.'</p>

<p>'It's not hap-hazard; it's just natural. They're
sorry for us and for everything, and they've just
come back as if nothing had happened. I really
think George is a born business man; he's quite left
off being half-asleep all the time,' cried Sarah.</p>

<p>'It's my belief he's been more wide awake than we
knew "all the time,"' quoted her uncle.</p>

<p>'Anyway, he's quite wide awake now. And, oh!
it's so funny to hear him when they come and ask
him some questions he doesn't know anything about.
He puts up his pince-nez, looks very wise, and says,
"You had better go on as you have always done
for the present."'</p>

<p>Mr Howroyd pinched her cheek. 'You are far
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
too wide awake, especially when it comes to criticising
other people. Well, I expect I can go back to my own
mill. I'm not wanted here. I shall soon be coming
to your George for advice. Dear, dear! who would
have thought it? He looked as if it was too much
trouble to live. This bad business has done you
both good&mdash;you as well as him, and you badly
wanted some improvement, my lass. It'll be a
proud day for your father when he hears what you
have both done,' said Mr Howroyd as he went off,
looking bright and cheery again.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></h3>

<h5>SARAH BECOMES A BUSINESS WOMAN.</h5>

<p>Mr Howroyd had not been gone very long
when George came in, his usually calm, unruffled
brow puckered, and his face wearing
a worried look. 'I say, Sarah, I'm afraid I've been
very presumptuous in undertaking to carry on my
father's business,' he said.</p>

<p>'What has happened? Aren't they behaving all
right?' inquired Sarah, looking anxiously at him.</p>

<p>'Oh, the hands? Yes. Hurst, the manager,
says they have come back in a good spirit, and are
working all they know to get the contract done.
He says he never saw smarter work,' George told
her.</p>

<p>'Then I don't see what you are worrying about,'
said Sarah, laughing, as she added, 'I expect they
want to show that they are as good as any "Frenchies,"
as they call the foreigners.'</p>

<p>'But that isn't the trouble; it's father's customers
and the people he has done business with. Some of
them have called in and intimated pretty plainly
that they don't mean to have any dealings with me,'
he observed.</p>

<p>'How horrid of them! They might at least have
waited to see how you got on,' exclaimed Sarah in
great indignation.</p>

<p>'Well, it was rather my own fault. I suppose they
can't afford to wait and see how things go in business.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
They began talking about business deals, and using
all sorts of terms which, I suppose, are current in the
wool-trade, and I let them see that I didn't understand
anything about it,' said George.</p>

<p>His face was so melancholy and his forehead so
wrinkled that Sarah burst into a hearty laugh.</p>

<p>'It's no laughing matter; it spells ruin to us if
our clients&mdash;customers, I mean&mdash;fight shy of us, and
we shall be worse off than if I had never meddled
with the matter,' he said severely.</p>

<p>'I am very sorry, George; but I could not help it;
it is so funny for you to be so worried and fidgety.
Why didn't you say Uncle Howroyd would stand
surety, and refer them to Hurst? He has been
manager for years, and father used to say that Hurst
knew as much about the business as he did himself.
If I were you I'd get him to write a circular-letter
to all those people, and say that in father's temporary
absence from business he is managing for you by
Mr Howroyd's advice.'</p>

<p>'I never thought of it. I'm very unfit for all this.
I like the dyeing and the chemical part of the business;
but what all these men said was Chinese to me.
I wish you'd just tell me what some of these words
mean,' he said, as he sat down to the table and began
questioning his sister.</p>

<p>'I can tell you a good deal, because, you see, I am
always down at Uncle Howroyd's, and he lets me go
into his office and talk to him while he is working.
I've often seen the other merchants and buyers come
in; but it seemed quite simple; they just ordered
what they wanted, and Uncle Howroyd put the
pieces on.'</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
'Put the pieces on what?' inquired George. 'Don't
laugh; tell me what that means.'</p>

<p>'Put the pieces to be made on to the machines&mdash;the
lengths of blanketing or cloth,' said Sarah.</p>

<p>'Excuse me, Mr George, but Mr Blakeley is here,'
said Ben the gate-keeper, coming into the office.</p>

<p>'Who is Mr Blakeley?' inquired George.</p>

<p>'He's one of our buyers, sir,' replied the man.</p>

<p>'Oh George, I know him! Do have him shown in
here,' entreated Sarah. 'He is such a nice, good-humoured
man.'</p>

<p>But circumstances alter cases, and Sarah was surprised
to find that the good-natured Mr Blakeley,
whom she always saw smiling and ready to complete
a deal with her Uncle Howroyd, became a brusque,
serious business man with her brother.</p>

<p>'I have an order on hand here, Mr Clay; but I
should prefer if you will allow me to cancel it. I
understand that there are changes in the mills, and
it is rather particular that it should be woven exactly
as it was,' he said, after having made some curt and
perfunctory inquiries after Mr Mark Clay's health.</p>

<p>George evidently did not understand what he
meant, and was just saying, with his usual courtesy,
'Oh, certainly; we should not, of course, hold you to
your word.'</p>

<p>But Sarah broke in. She had been used to
talk to these men when they came to see her uncle,
and they had all admired the handsome girl, and
showed her attention to please her uncle, who was
evidently very fond of her and proud of his niece.
So she felt no shyness with Mr Blakeley, and said,
'What difference do the changes make, Mr Blakeley?
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
My father did not weave the cloth, and the manager
and foremen who looked after these things are still
here.'</p>

<p>Mr Blakeley looked at her, and an amused smile
crept over his face at her business-like tone. 'Quite
true, Miss Sarah; but the weavers of this particular
cloth have left, I understand, and I would rather not
trust it to new ones.'</p>

<p>'Of course not,' began George.</p>

<p>But Sarah interrupted again. 'You'd better hear
what our manager has to say. Father won't be
pleased if he finds we have sent good customers
away.'</p>

<p>'There's a good business woman for you!' cried
Mr Blakeley with a laugh. ''Tis a pity you are not
a man; you could go into partnership with your
brother and father.'</p>

<p>Meanwhile George had acted on Sarah's advice,
and sent for Mr Hurst, who came at once. 'There's
no call for you to withdraw your order, Mr Blakeley.
We've got the wools you asked for, and there's one
of the weavers who has done your cloth before, so I
think you may be easy in your mind about its being
done as well as ever. We're turning out some fine
work, and there's a new shade you might find useful,
which perhaps you'd like to see.'</p>

<p>Mr Blakeley pricked up his ears at the news of a
new shade, and went off quite eagerly with the
manager.</p>

<p>George heaved a sigh of relief. 'You pulled us
through that time, Sarah; but it won't always go
like that. I can't push.'</p>

<p>'You must, or you'll get pushed to the wall; but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
I have had another inspiration since I came down.
Why don't you weave a lot of coat-lengths of that
new shade? It's much more suitable for that than
for blankets.'</p>

<p>'I thought the same thing when I saw it, and said
something of the kind to father, and he said he
should try samples. They were almost the last words
he said to me that day before he left me.'</p>

<p>'It was only yesterday,' observed Sarah.</p>

<p>George stared at her. 'So it was! I can hardly
believe it. It seems weeks ago; but I am glad you
reminded me of it, for it will please father to find
we have carried out his wishes, and I think it
might "catch on," as he said.'</p>

<p>'The fact is, you've got dazed with the shock. I
believe you felt it more than I did. I am very sorry
for father being ill, and I think the hands who burnt
our house behaved disgracefully, and I'm glad they
were turned off; but I can't help feeling that it was
father's own fault, and that perhaps it will do him
good.'</p>

<p>'It's not our business to judge his treatment of his
employ&eacute;s. He was a very liberal father to us,' said
George.</p>

<p>'You are not so hard-hearted'&mdash;&mdash;began Sarah;
but a prolonged ringing at the telephone interrupted
her.</p>

<p>'It's mother,' she announced, 'and she's calling
for you.'</p>

<p>George went and listened. 'Father is conscious,
and has asked for us,' he cried, and his face lightened.</p>

<p>'I'm very glad,' replied Sarah quietly; but her
face showed no such joy as her brother's. It is to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
be feared that where her father was concerned Sarah
was somewhat hard-hearted.</p>

<p>'We must go at once,' said her brother, taking
up his hat.</p>

<p>'I don't think you ought to leave the mill till the
dinner-hour. The bell will ring in a quarter of an
hour. Can't you wait till then?' objected Sarah,
who, as is seen, was more business-like than her
brother, thanks to her intercourse with her uncle
Howroyd.</p>

<p>'Perhaps you are right. Then you had better go,
and say I will be there almost directly,' he suggested.</p>

<p>Sarah started with mingled feelings. She was
glad, really glad, that her father had recovered consciousness,
and was therefore, she supposed, getting
better; but the fact was, Sarah felt very resentful
and sore that he had made himself so hated, and she
walked very slowly along the streets that separated
her father's mills from Mr Howroyd's.</p>

<p>''E knows me, Sarah!' cried her mother, whose
face was transfigured with joy. 'Thanks be to God,
'e knows me, my dear 'usband!'</p>

<p>For the life of her, Sarah could not show any
great joy, but only inquired, 'Has he asked for me,
or is it only George he wants to see, mother?'</p>

<p>''E mentioned you both, an' asked w'ere Sally was,'
said her mother, forgetting, in her great relief, the
small detail that Sarah disliked being called so.</p>

<p>'Then I'd better go to him and tell him George
will come in as soon as he can leave the mills,' said
Sarah, preparing to go into the sitting-room, which
was still being used as the stricken man's bedroom.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
'Don't you say any such thing! Don't you breathe
a word about the mills or Balmoral or anything. 'E's
not to be excited, the doctor says. I've 'alf a mind
to tell 'im 'e shall see you by-and-by; it would be a
dreadful thing if you were to upset 'im. You don't
always get on too well with your father, Sarah,' Mrs
Clay wound up reproachfully.</p>

<p>'I sha'n't say anything to upset father while he is
lying there so ill. I only meant to explain why
George did not come at once,' explained Sarah.</p>

<p>'You needn't explain. Sick folk don't want
explanations,' objected Mrs Clay. 'Say George is
out.'</p>

<p>'Very well,' agreed Sarah, and she went into the
sick-room. It was a relief not to see her father lying
there with unseeing eyes and breathing so heavily;
but, somehow, Sarah felt very uncomfortable under
his keen glance to-day. Still, she managed to say,
'I am glad you are better, father.'</p>

<p>'Ay, I'm going to get better; but I'll never be
the man I was. I've made a mess of it, Sally, and
I shall not leave you the big fortune I meant you to
have to match your pretty face, my little lass. I've
not done right, and I shall never be able to do it
now,' said the sick man.</p>

<p>'Yes, you will, father. You will be all right in a
few weeks, and you can make another fortune, and
build Balmoral again,' cried Sarah eagerly, as she
impulsively took her father's hand, and then started
on finding that it lay limp in hers.</p>

<p>A spasm passed over the invalid's face at her
words; and if Mrs Clay had not been too much
afraid of her husband she would have stopped Sarah
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
and sent her away. As it was, she gave a little
groan from the background, as much as to say,
'You've done the very thing I told you not
to do.'</p>

<p>'There'll never be another Balmoral. It would
take me too long, and I doubt if Clay's Mills will
ever be themselves again. I'd like those fellows to
be sent off the minute the contract's done. It'll take
them another week; but I'll be glad to see the backs
of them. I wish they'd never come,' said Mr Clay,
who seemed to have a feverish desire to talk.</p>

<p>'They've gone, father,' said Sarah.</p>

<p>But this was too much for Mrs Clay's patience.
'That'll do, Sarah. Your father's not got to talk
business w'ile 'e's so bad.&mdash;There, Mark, don't you
worry; everything's going on as well as can be expected,'
she said, in what she thought was a soothing
tone.</p>

<p>Her husband waved her aside. 'Let be, Polly!
Let the lass speak; I must know the worst.&mdash;So
they've gone, the villains! When they thought I was
done for, the rats forsook the sinking ship. Ay,
'twas a bad day for us, was yon. Well, that ends it!
The credit of Clay's Mills has gone for ever. I'd
best not get better. You'll have a little something
to live on; and that's all I've done with my toiling
and moiling. I'm best dead,' he said.</p>

<p>Mrs Clay grasped Sarah's arm in a convulsive grip.
'Don't breathe another word. I forbid you!'</p>

<p>Sarah felt sure she should do more good by speaking;
but she remained obediently silent.</p>

<p>'It's strange&mdash;a sick man's fancy, I suppose&mdash;but
I thought I heard our bell. There's no mistaking it.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
And, hark! there it is again. Am I light-headed,
Polly, or what's that bell I heard?' he asked.</p>

<p>'No, Mark, no, you're not light-headed; it is your
own bell. All's goin' as well as can be expected,'
replied poor Mrs Clay.</p>

<p>'What does she mean? Speak up, my lass; why
are they ringing my bell? Speak, I tell you!' he
commanded.</p>

<p>So Sarah spoke, and told him what her brother
had done.</p>

<p>The mill-owner listened in silence, and Sarah
scarcely recognised her father's voice when he said,
'Thank God, my credit's saved! I don't deserve such
children; but you take after your mother, and she's
brought you up right. I've been a hard man, and
I'd have been your ruin if you hadn't prevented it.'
Then he shut his eyes, only to open them and say,
'Tell the hands I'm glad they've come back;' and
with a sigh he went off into a refreshing sleep.</p>

<p>'And, oh George! he was so different, so humble
and gentle. It did make me feel so ashamed of
myself,' cried Sarah to her brother when he came
in to lunch.</p>

<p>'I'm glad to hear it. It's about time you were,'
announced George.</p>

<p>'You needn't say that now,' said Sarah, 'just when
everything is going all right.'</p>

<p>'I don't know that everything is going all right;
in fact, I'm rather glad I did not come in time to
talk to father, for I should not have given such a
glowing account of everything as you have,' he
remarked.</p>

<p>'You are dreadfully pessimistic. Of course there
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
are ups and downs in business; it's only that you
are not used to it,' insisted Sarah.</p>

<p>'It's mostly downs at present unfortunately,' said
George; and he was to repeat the remark only too
often in the weeks that followed.</p>

<hr class="para" />
<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX"></a>CHAPTER XXIX.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></h3>

<h5>'A MIRACLE.'</h5>

<p>It was some weeks after the events related in the
last chapter, and George was looking years
older, so his mother told him.</p>

<p>'Nay, lad, you must let me help you,' said Mr
Howroyd. 'I've a few thousands lying idle, and
you'll want them to keep the mills going for the
next few weeks.'</p>

<p>'Do you mean to say it costs a thousand a week to
keep the mills going?' cried Sarah.</p>

<p>'It does that, lass, and I hear you've no orders
coming in,' replied her uncle.</p>

<p>'Then what's the good of their doing work if no
one will buy it?' said Sarah, whose enthusiasm had
died out, and who was now as pessimistic as her
brother.</p>

<p>'Have it done ready for buyers. We often have
to fill our warehouses in bad times till we can find a
market for our goods; and as George won't go and
ask for orders'&mdash;&mdash;began his uncle.</p>

<p>'I really could not, Uncle Howroyd. I should feel
like a beggar,' protested George.</p>

<p>'Then you must sit here and wait till buyers come;
it's only a case of holding out long enough. Hurst
is a good man, and a first-rate manager. I don't
know why the buyers have left you. I'm afraid
it's some mischief that's been made over the trial
of the young men for firing the house, and their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
heavy sentence. It has not done Clay's Mills any
good.'</p>

<p>'I know that, uncle, and that's why I don't want
to take your money. It's only throwing good money
after bad,' said George.</p>

<p>'Haven't I got any money?' inquired Sarah.</p>

<p>Mr Howroyd laughed as he said, 'Not yet.
You'll have all that and more when I'm dead and
gone.'</p>

<p>'And I hope that will be never!' cried Sarah
impetuously.</p>

<p>'Then you'd better take this money now. I've
neither chick nor child, so it's yours,' he said with
his cheery smile.</p>

<p>'George, I think you'd better. Taking it from
Uncle Howroyd is not taking charity,' said Sarah.</p>

<p>'I should think not,' put in her uncle.</p>

<p>George let himself be persuaded, in spite of his firm
conviction that feeling was so strong against Clay's
Mills and their owners, and that they were practically
being boycotted by the buyers.</p>

<p>And he was right. The weeks dragged on, and
since the big contract, which had been finished
and sent off to time, thanks to the goodwill of the
hands, no order of any importance had come in, and
George heard of them being placed elsewhere in the
town.</p>

<p>'It's no good, Sarah,' he said one day. 'I knew
we were done for when I read that article in the
paper about ill-gotten gains, and there have been
others since.'</p>

<p>'Is Uncle Howroyd's money gone?' inquired Sarah.</p>

<p>'Practically, and the warehouses are full. I mind
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
more for father and the hands; they've come back to
us, and everything is going well in the mills, and
Hurst is a good business man; but it's no use
making good cloth if people won't buy it.'</p>

<p>'Hasn't the new dye taken at all?' inquired
Sarah.</p>

<p>'Yes, to a certain extent, and it is the only thing
we are selling; but it wants some fashionable person
to take it up, and I really couldn't push it or ask
any of my friends,' he observed.</p>

<p>'I might ask Horatia to get her mother to have a
costume that colour,' said Sarah doubtfully; 'but she
hasn't written lately. She said they were coming
up north in their motor, and should call and see us
all. But I expect they've read those things that
have been written, and don't want to have anything
to do with us now we're ruined, or going to be.'</p>

<p>'In that case you can't possibly write to her. But
I wish I knew what to do. I have even been to see
some of the buyers, only to be refused,' said George a
little bitterly.</p>

<p>'Oh, have you really? That was plucky of you,
because I know you hate it so. I do wish something
would happen. I hate going into father's room and
having to tell him that things are rather slack. You
know the doctor says he will soon be able to go down
to the mills himself, and then he'll know the truth,'
said Sarah, who, it will be observed, had quite changed
in her feelings towards her father.</p>

<p>'Well, they say when things come to the worst
they will mend, and things have come to about the
worst with us, so let's hope they will mend,' said
George, rousing himself and trying to speak cheerfully.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
'That proverb is rubbish,' said Sarah, with some of
her old violence; 'things often come to the worst and
just end there.'</p>

<p>'We've done our best, anyway, so we shall have
that consolation,' remarked George.</p>

<p>'How much longer can you hold out?' inquired the
practical Sarah.</p>

<p>'Practically I'm at the end of my tether, and was
thinking of warning the hands that the mills may
have to shut down at the end of next week.'</p>

<p>'Oh, wait a day, George, and don't do anything
without asking father first; he ought to be asked,
and he may think of a way out of the difficulty,'
entreated his sister.</p>

<p>'All right; but a day won't make any difference,
unless a miracle happens,' observed George.</p>

<p>'Father will have been out for his first drive, and
will be stronger, for one thing,' said Sarah. 'And,
who knows? a miracle may happen.'</p>

<p>'Lady Grace and Mr and Miss Cunningham to see
you, Miss Sarah,' announced Sykes.</p>

<p>Sarah gave a little cry of joy, and looked significantly
at her brother. 'Oh George'&mdash;&mdash;she began.</p>

<p>But he said hastily, 'Don't ask a favour, Sarah.
When people come to pay a call of civility they don't
want to be bothered about business.'</p>

<p>'Very well,' said Sarah, who was not so self-willed
as she used to be.</p>

<p>Horatia rushed at her. 'Oh Sarah! I am so glad to
see you, and so sorry to see Balmoral&mdash;I mean, not
to see it. Father wants to look over your mills, and
I want to see your father,' she cried, bubbling over
with high spirits as ever.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
Meanwhile Lady Grace and Mr Cunningham were
shaking hands with George, and congratulating him
upon his energy and plucky attempt to keep on his
father's business.</p>

<p>'Let's all go down to the mills,' cried Horatia.</p>

<p>'It's dinner-hour now; but if you will stop and
have lunch with us we shall be very glad, and we
will go after lunch. It won't be a Balmoral lunch,'
said George, smiling at her.</p>

<p>'All the better; we shall be finished the sooner,'
said Horatia,' and the mills take an awfully long time
to see.'</p>

<p>'Then will you come and see father? He does not
come down yet, and mother has her lunch with him;
she can't bear to leave him,' said Sarah.</p>

<p>Horatia accordingly went off with Sarah, and found
the mill-owner looking very different; but it was
Mrs Clay who seemed the most changed. She looked
years younger, and so quietly happy. Horatia could
not understand it at all, not being given to troubling
her head about people's characters.</p>

<p>After lunch&mdash;which, after all, was a very good one,
and served in Sykes's best style, to do honour to the
guests&mdash;the party drove down to the mills.</p>

<p>Sarah could not help thinking what a good thing
it would be if Lady Grace Cunningham should take
a fancy to this new cloth, she was such a striking-looking
woman, and a well-known figure in society;
but the girl determined not to suggest it, though
her heart beat a little quicker when they were coming
to the dyeing-rooms.</p>

<p>Before this they passed the warehouses, and George
good-naturedly opened the doors to let Horatia see
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
more blankets than she would ever see again in
her life.</p>

<p>'How full it is! This place was quite empty when
I last came,' she cried innocently.</p>

<p>George blushed like a girl. 'It's a slack time with
us,' he said, and hastily shut the door.</p>

<p>But Mr Cunningham stopped a moment. 'They
are not sold, then?' he inquired.</p>

<p>'No,' said George; 'but let me show you something
more interesting.'</p>

<p>'Then it's rather fortunate I called, for I fancy I
know a buyer. It's a large line of steamers I have
a share in that are starting, and want a big consignment
of blankets to be numbered and delivered by a
near date,' said Mr Cunningham; and he began to
go into figures with George.</p>

<p>The two went off with the manager to do some
telephoning, and Lady Grace Cunningham walked
on with the two girls to the dyeing-rooms. Sarah
felt more than ever that she could not say anything,
though she showed the new shade and the cloth.</p>

<p>'Oh mother, do have a coat and skirt of it!' cried
Horatia. 'It does suit you so well! Just see!'</p>

<p>'But I don't suppose I am allowed to buy it wholesale
like this?' Lady Grace protested.</p>

<p>'I believe one firm in London has stocked some.
George will know the name,' said Sarah; but her eyes
were shining with such pleasure that Lady Grace saw
that the suggestion had given great pleasure.</p>

<p>'If you will let me have the name I will certainly
order a costume. I have never seen the shade, and I
think it ought to become very popular; it is such a
good winter colour,' she said.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
'Thank you very much,' said Sarah quietly; but
her face said a great deal more.</p>

<p>When Mr Cunningham joined them, Horatia insisted
on his looking at the new cloth. He admired
it as much as his wife, and said, 'I wish you'd have
a dress of that shade. I'm so sick of dull colours,
and this is really becoming.'</p>

<p>Horatia clapped her hands. 'She's going to when
Mr Clay tells us the name of the place where you can
buy it.'</p>

<p>'I can do that; but you would give me great
pleasure if you would let me send you a length,' said
George.</p>

<p>And Lady Grace gracefully accepted the offer,
knowing that it gave the young man, as he said,
great pleasure; and adding, 'But let me know where
it can be got in London, for I am sure to be asked.'</p>

<p>When they took their leave, George and Sarah
looked at each other, smiling. 'The miracle has
happened, George!' the latter exclaimed.</p>

<p>'Thank goodness!' he said. 'Oh Sarah, if you
only knew how that warehouse full of blankets has
weighed upon me!'</p>

<p>'Then I wonder you're alive to tell the tale,' said a
cheery voice behind him.</p>

<p>They both laughed. 'Oh Uncle Howroyd, isn't it
lovely? Mr Cunningham has given George such a big
order, and Lady Grace is going to wear the new
shade. They've been to call.'</p>

<p>'I know. They called on me first,' said their uncle.</p>

<p>'Did you ask them to help us?' cried Sarah, her
face falling.</p>

<p>'Nay, lass; I'm as proud as you, and I never said a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
word except that young George was battling bravely.
Mr Cunningham told me he had come on purpose to
see if he could get blankets, and, as a matter of fact,
he asked me; but I hadn't any ready. So, you see, it
was Providence helping those who help themselves,' he
replied.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Cunninghams were speeding south
with the dress-length packed in the carrier at the
back of the motor.</p>

<p>'I don't recognise the description I heard of that
family,' observed Lady Grace Cunningham; 'and it
just shows that one must never believe what one
hears, for according to you and Nanny they were
very different.'</p>

<p>'Yes; I noticed that. And young Clay, too, is not
in the least like Maxwell's description of him. He said
the young man was an easy-going fellow, who looked
always half-asleep, as if life was a bore to live, and
was only fit to lounge in fashionable drawing-rooms.
I shall ask him what he means,' said her husband.</p>

<p>'But that's how Sarah talked of him. I expect
he's changed, and so is she; in fact, they are all
changed,' declared Horatia.</p>

<p>'But you told me Mrs Clay was a meek, trodden-down
creature, and Mr Clay a rather violent man,
and that Sarah could not bear him. And as for
Nanny's description, it was worse still, and I find Mrs
Clay very different, and Sarah is devoted to her
parents, especially her father.'</p>

<p>'I know,' agreed Horatia, nodding her head. 'I
was so astonished that my eyes nearly dropped out
of my head. But it's the fire that has done it. It's
burst up all their bad qualities. I can tell you it was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
pretty uncomfortable last time I stayed there; and
when you tell Nanny your opinion of them, she'll say
a miracle must have happened.'</p>

<p>'I think they have been having a hard struggle.
The young fellow betrayed it when he showed that
full warehouse. I heard something about it. There
is a feeling against them. Even our shipping people
objected to trading with them. But I'm glad I persuaded
them; it may give them a lift, and one thing
leads to another.'</p>

<p>'Yes; and you must make that shade the fashion,
mother. Wear it at your big reception, will you?'
begged Horatia.</p>

<p>'And get it copied at once?' laughed her mother.</p>

<p>'Yes, because Mr Clay was so kind to me. Think
of that rink that he had made just to please me!'
cried Horatia.</p>

<p>'Ah, that was a waste of money! They won't be
able to throw their money about like that for some
time to come,' said Mr Cunningham, shaking his head.</p>

<p>'No; and a good thing, too. I don't approve of
these colossal fortunes,' said his wife.</p>

<p>'Unless one has it one's self,' laughed her husband.</p>

<p>'It just shows how quickly they can be lost,' she
observed.</p>

<p>'Well, it seems to have done them all good, so I
don't think we need regret it or pity them,' said Mr
Cunningham.</p>

<p>'Only, I do wish you had seen Balmoral; it was like
Aladdin's palace. I never saw anything like it,' cried
Horatia.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></h3>

<h5>LAST.</h5>

<p>The worst had come and passed.
Two days later Mr Clay announced his
intention of going down to the mill. 'Not
that I'm going to take things out of your hand, lad&mdash;nay,
I shall never be good for much again&mdash;but just
to see the old place, and say a word to some of the
hands,' he explained.</p>

<p>'Will you wait till this afternoon, father?' asked
George.</p>

<p>'Why? What's doing?' inquired his father.</p>

<p>'Only carrying bales for a big order,' said George.</p>

<p>'I'd like to see that; it means business,' persisted
the mill-owner. And he had his way.</p>

<p>'I wanted to get the warehouse cleared before he
came,' George explained to his sister, who was his
confidante; for Mrs Clay, strange to say, took no
interest in the mills or her son's proceedings except
so far as it 'pleased father.'</p>

<p>However, Mr Clay came down, and saw the huge
bales being sent off to the shipping line. His quick
business eye took in the whole situation at a glance.
'You've been slack. It's been a heavy pull,' he said
gravely.</p>

<p>'Yes, father; but the worst is over, and things are
looking up. We've cleared this side, and I've had
two more smaller orders since Mr Cunningham's,' said
his son.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
'And you've borne all that worry alone, and never
told me a word. You're too good to your old father,
both of you, for I've brought it on you; it's me the
buyers have forsaken, not you. But they'll come
round again. We make good cloth and blankets, and
they know it,' he said; but he did not boast as he used
to do.</p>

<p>The hands, looking rather ashamed and shy, greeted
him respectfully as he walked slowly along, dragging
his paralysed foot after him. 'I'm glad to see you
again,' he said again and again.</p>

<p>But when he had gone, they shook their heads and
said Mark Clay would never be the man he had been,
and that it was the young master they must look to
now.</p>

<p>'And a good master he'll be, though he's a bit too
polite, and down upon what he calls rudeness, which
is only our way,' said one of the young men.</p>

<p>'You've taught them London manners, lad,' said
Mark Clay, looking at his son quizzically, as he noticed
how no man, woman, or child passed the young master
without some greeting.</p>

<p>George laughed. 'I couldn't stand their rough
ways,' he admitted.</p>

<p>'Well, I've nought against it, and I see you've
made some other alterations for their benefit; but I've
nought against that either. You've done well by the
mill and by me, and I'm proud of you, and proud of
my girl, for she's got a shrewd business head, too, it
seems.'</p>

<p>'Yes; I couldn't have done it without her. She is so
quick, and seems to know the right thing by instinct,'
said George.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
'That's the woman's way. It's wonderful how
they'll see things we can't. Your mother's the
same,' replied Mark Clay.</p>

<p>And George made no comment on this change
of front, though he remembered the times without
number that his blood had boiled when the millionaire
had spoken contemptuously of his wife, and told her
that she did not know what she was talking about.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It is two years later, and a motor-car drove up to a
beautiful house that stood on the place that Balmoral
formerly occupied. Out of the motor stepped a young
man with a good-humoured, freckled face, very like
Horatia, whom he handed out, and who was now a
very nice-looking girl of seventeen.</p>

<p>'We've come to your house-warming, Sarah,' she
cried. 'And, oh, what a beautiful house! It's almost
as good as the last one. And you've got a marble staircase
and all. Why, it's exactly like the other!' she
cried.</p>

<p>Sarah shook her head. 'It's not so big or so grand;
but we tried to make it like the last to please father
and mother. Poor mother was always talking of her
marble staircase, so that's exactly copied, and so is
the parquetry flooring, and her rooms are as like as we
could make them; but we have no royal apartments
for you this time,' she said.</p>

<p>'I'm glad of it. I don't mind telling you now that
I used to have a nightmare every night, dreaming that
burglars had come in and murdered me for my wealth&mdash;thinking
it was mine, you know,' Horatia confided
to her.</p>

<p>'Father is in the drawing-room waiting to see you.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
He is still rather an invalid,' said Sarah as she led the
way to it.</p>

<p>'It's almost the same, Sarah!' Horatia cried again.
'Yes; and we still have the gold plate and S&egrave;vres
china. Sykes saved a lot of things, we found afterwards;
but it's not so palatial, and father wouldn't
have it called Balmoral any more. He said that was
boastful.'</p>

<p>'Oh! What is the name of the house, then?'
inquired Horatia.</p>

<p>'Father will tell you,' said Sarah.</p>

<p>'So you've kept your promise, and come to stay
with us again; only, this time it's my son's house,' said
Mr Mark Clay.</p>

<p>'Oh no, father; he says not,' cried Sarah.</p>

<p>Mr Clay shook his head.  'I lost my all when I
lost Balmoral, and he built up the fortune again. I'll
never have a mansion here; but I'm content to stay
in my son's till I get a mansion in the sky,' he said.</p>

<p>Horatia smiled at the allusion to her speech. 'What
is the name of the house?' she asked.</p>

<p>'Horatia House. We all wished to have something
to remind us that it was your family we had to thank
for having a home again. You made the tide turn
and the dye take. George wanted to call it Arnedale
House, after your ancestor; but Sarah said, "Call it
Horatia House," and so we did.'</p>

<p>'And a very pretty name it is,' said little Mrs Clay,
who looked very pretty herself.</p>

<p>'That is a very pretty compliment you have paid
me! I feel I ought to make a pretty speech of thanks,
but I don't know how,' cried Horatia with a merry
laugh.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
'Here's the mill-owner,' said his father, as George
came in, looking as aristocratic as ever, with the same
pleasant smile and perfect manners, only wide awake.
'I've a right to be proud of my children, haven't I?
They're all I am proud of now,' said Mr Clay as he
took a hand of each.</p>

<p>And Horatia and her brother agreed with him that
he had a right to be proud of his children.</p>
